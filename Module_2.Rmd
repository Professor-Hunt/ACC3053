# Excel

![](images/excel_meme.png){width="40%"}

I may trash talk excel üòà, but I would argue that it is the most used tool for accountants. Accountants are the **original** data scientists[^1] and their weapon of choice has been excel. A large portion of this class will be using R, **BUT** I hope to show you that R and Excel can work together. At the very least you will learn how to do everything we see in this module in R and you can decide which tool you want to use. üòè This case study is provided by [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/careers/university-relations/data-and-analytics-case-studies.html). It was developed for a [masters level course](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/careers/university-relations/data-and-analytics-case-studies.html), but I am adapting it for our class.
