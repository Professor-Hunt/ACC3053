# Filtering Joins

Filtering joins match observations in the same way as mutating joins, but affect the observations, not the variables. There are two types:

-   `semi_join(x, y)` **keeps** all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`.

-   `anti_join(x, y)` **drops** all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`.

Semi-joins are useful for matching filtered summary tables back to the original rows.

Graphically, a semi-join looks like this:

Only the existence of a match is important; it doesn't matter which observation is matched. This means that filtering joins never duplicate rows like mutating joins do:

The inverse of a semi-join is an anti-join. An anti-join keeps the rows that *don't* have a match:

Anti-joins are useful for diagnosing join mismatches.

# Set Operations

The final type of two-table verb are the set operations. Generally, I use these the least frequently, but they are occasionally useful when you want to break a single complex filter into simpler pieces. All these operations work with a complete row, comparing the values of every variable. These expect the `x` and `y` inputs to have the same variables, and treat the observations like sets:

-   [`intersect(x, y)`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sets.html): return only observations in both `x` and `y`.

-   [`union(x, y)`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sets.html): return unique observations in `x` and `y`.

-   [`setdiff(x, y)`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sets.html): return observations in `x`, but not in `y`.

Given this simple data:

```{r,echo=TRUE}

library(tidyverse)

df1 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   2,  1
)
df2 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   1,  2
)

```

The four possibilities are:

```{r,echo=TRUE}

intersect(df1, df2)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 2
#>       x     y
#>   <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1     1     1

# Note that we get 3 rows, not 4
union(df1, df2)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>       x     y
#>   <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1     1     1
#> 2     2     1
#> 3     1     2

setdiff(df1, df2)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 2
#>       x     y
#>   <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1     2     1

setdiff(df2, df1)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 2
#>       x     y
#>   <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1     1     2

```

This is an important property of what's known as *normal forms* of data. The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called *normalization*. More information is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).

Both `dplyr` and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) we mentioned in the introduction of this chapter use such *normal forms*. Given that they share such commonalities, once you learn either of these two tools, you can learn the other very easily.

Another useful function is `rename()`, which as you may have guessed changes the name of variables.

We can also return the top `n` values of a variable using the `top_n()` function.
