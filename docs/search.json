R lends itself well to business because of its depth of topic-specific packages and its communication infrastructure. R has packages covering a wide range of topics such as econometrics, finance, and time series. R has best-in-class tools for visualization, reporting, and interactivity, which are as important to business as they are to science. Because of this, R is well-suited for scientists, engineers and business professionals.1\r\nThere are plenty of advantages of using R instead of other software packages…\r\nComplete statistical environment and programming language\r\nR integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically. R code is great for reproducibility. Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.\r\nEfficient functions and data structures for data analysis\r\nR is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient. R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web. The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you.\r\nPowerful graphics\r\nThe plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.\r\nAccess to fast growing number of analysis packages\r\nWith 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more. R has a large and welcoming community. Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, or on the RStudio community.\r\nTechnical advantages: free, open-source, available for all OSs\r\nAnyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.\r\nIt’s easy to get distracted by Tableau and PowerBI’s visuals, but when it comes to making business decisions, your organization needs to be able to take actions. This is where R is lightyears ahead of the other tools.\r\nbusiness-science\r\nTools like Excel and tableau are easier to learn, but have a lower Business Capability. R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing. The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands. So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again. Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes. Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.2\r\nExcel is still relevant\r\nExcel is still the most widely used analysis tool in business. Every accountant will use excel.\r\nThen why learn anything else? See above. Also, we will learn to use excel and R together.\r\nDB Browser for SQLite\r\nDB Browser for SQLite3 (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.\r\nDB4S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit databases. DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.\r\nControls and wizards are available for users to:\r\nCreate and compact database files\r\nCreate, define, modify and delete tables\r\nCreate, define, and delete indexes\r\nBrowse, edit, add, and delete records\r\nSearch records\r\nImport and export records as text\r\nImport and export tables from/to CSV files\r\nImport and export databases from/to SQL dump files\r\nIssue SQL queries and inspect the results\r\nExamine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application\r\nPlot simple graphs based on table or query data\r\nDatabases have a very large place in businesses. Accountants will interact with databases or data retrieved from a database. Large companies cannot exist without databases.\r\nWhat is Data Analytics?\r\nA buzz word for sure. But it is becoming more clear everyday. Analytics is the process which will help you to make meaningful conclusions. A lot of industries have recognized the potential that big data and analytics provide. One such industry where we can see the significant potential is the Accounting world.\r\nThe data that exists is scattered, often unused until it is pulled for an audit or a tax return. There was a time when only samples were selected and verified during an audit but now with the advent of Data Analytics auditors are able to analyze the business 24*7.\r\nTo understand the changing customer behavior and market trends Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and finance leaders are embracing accounting software equipped with “Big data” and analytic techniques. The predictive power of data analytics enables CFO’s to make financial decisions based not on what happened in the past but what is likely to happen in the future.\r\nSo why is data analytics so important in accounting?\r\nAccountants use accounting software empowered with data analytics to help businesses uncover the most valuable insights associated with finance, identify process improvements that can increase efficiency and better manage risks. Data analytics gives them the necessary tool-set to strengthen their partnership with business leaders.\r\nA few examples\r\nAuditors who are working both externally and internally can shift from a sample based model to model that allows continuous monitoring where larger data sets can be analyzed and verified. The outcome is less margin of error and more precise recommendations.\r\nTax accountants can also use data science to quickly analyze complex taxation questions related to investment scenarios.\r\nAccountants use big data to study the consumer behavioral patterns. These help businesses build analytic models which can help them identify investment opportunities and generate higher profit margins.\r\nFour Types of Data Analytics every accountant should be aware of\r\n1- Descriptive Analytics = “What happening?”\r\nThis one is used most often and includes classification and categorization of information. Accountants keep an eagle eye on the flow of money through their organization – they take care of the revenue and expenses, inventory counts and sales tax collected. Accurate generation is a trademark of solid accounting practices and for this accurate report generation compiling and verifying large amounts of data is important.\r\n2- Diagnostic Analytics = “Why did it happen?”\r\nDiagnostic is primarily used to monitor the changes in the data. Accountants on daily basis analyze the variances in the data and calculate the historical performance. A lot of accountants use variance analysis for budgeting. There is also specialized accounting software available in the market that can be used for detecting high-risk transactions.\r\n3- Predictive Analytics = “What’s likely to happen”?\r\nIn the predictive analysis, data is used to access the likelihood of future outcomes. Accountants are experts in building forecasts and identifying patterns and trends that shape those forecasts.\r\n4- Prescriptive Analysis =“What should we do?”\r\nSimulation and optimization of data are done to answer questions such as “what should we do?” It is something that is not just limited to recommendations and goes beyond that. It is actually executing actions or taking decisions that are right for a particular situation. The prescriptive analysis is used to answer\" What steps or interventions need to be taken to achieve the required outcome?\"\r\nDescriptive and diagnostic analytics usually depend on analytics tools that have the capacity to handle the manipulation of large sets of data. Examples include SQL, Oracle DB, Hadoop, Tableau, Microsoft Access, R, python etc.\r\nPredictive and Prescriptive analysis rely on analytics tools that have mathematical modeling capabilities. Examples include SAS, R, Python, optimization tools like Garrobi, Riverlogic; simulation tools like Analogic, natural Language processing tools like Natural Language Toolkit or OpenNLP.\r\nThe Future\r\nIt is expected that in the coming years there will be a tremendous use of analytic tools. Accounting professionals will delve themselves deeper into the combined analysis of structured data such as financial statements and unstructured data such as the large volume of client contracts. They will provide more extensive data analytics and quality business insights.\r\nMachine learning, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, blockchain will have a major impact on the profession. But the fact also cannot be denied that “all these technologies in one or another way depends on data”. If you can’t analyze data you cannot do machine learning, you cannot do robotics and you cannot do blockchain.\r\nTherefore it is important that the accountants to take a deep dive into the pool of data and enable themselves to ask better questions and get better answers.\r\nTo make the most out of data analytics such that it suits the needs of the accountants as well as the organization, a clear plan should be carved out that articulates the three components parts- data, analytics, and people. All the three components should be integrated and aligned to create business value.4\r\nAnother good Article\r\nData Analytics in Accounting\r\nLets look at some examples (in no particular order)\r\nDeloitte\r\nKPMG\r\nEY\r\nPWC\r\nHow Can Data Analytics be Helpful to Accountants?\r\nGiven the information above what examples did you see?\r\nTo be turned in:\r\nsubmit a brief summary of what you believe data analytics is and how you think that it might be useful to accountants.\r\n\r\nSEE CANVAS FOR ASSIGNMENT DETAILS\r\n\r\nInstall/update R and RStudio5\r\nR and RStudio are two separate pieces of software:\r\nR is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis\r\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R.\r\nIf you don’t already have R and RStudio installed, follow the instructions for your operating system below. You have to install R before you install RStudio.\r\nWindows\r\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\r\nRun the .exe file that was just downloaded\r\nGo to the RStudio download page\r\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows Vista/7/8/10 (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\r\nDouble click the file to install it\r\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\r\nMacOS\r\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\r\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\r\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\r\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\r\nGo to the RStudio download page\r\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit) (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\r\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\r\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\r\nUpdate R and RStudio\r\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed, check if your R and RStudio are up to date:\r\nWhen you open RStudio your R version will be printed in the console on the bottom left. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo() into the console. If your R version is 4.0.0 or later, you don’t need to update R for this lesson. If your version of R is older than that, download and install the latest version of R from the R project website for Windows, for MacOS, or for Linux\r\nTo update RStudio to the latest version, open RStudio and click on Help\" > Check for updates. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, follow the instruction on screen.\r\nNote: It is not necessary to remove old versions of R from your system, but if you wish to do so you can check How do I uninstall R?\r\nInstall DB Browser\r\nDownload DB Browser for SQLite from their website\r\nSelect the appropriate download for your respective operating system Windows or MacOS (which you should know given the steps above).\r\nMSSTATE ITS Provides Microsoft Excel if you do not have it. I believe they have it available for windows/macOS\r\nLayout of Technology\r\nRStudio\r\nR vs RstudioRStudioRStudio PanesIf you are interested in customizing your RStudio GUI see this article.\r\nDB Browser\r\nDB BrowserDB Browser SQL\r\nhttps://www.business-science.io/business/2020/12/17/six-reasons-to-use-R-for-business-2021.html↩︎\r\nhttps://www.mle.hamburg/_repos/dat_sci/00_preface/↩︎\r\nhttps://sqlitebrowser.org/↩︎\r\nThings you Should Know About Data Analytics in Accounting – StartupGuys.net↩︎\r\nhttps://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#Install_R_and_RStudio↩︎\r\n",

We are going to learn the basics ETL using mostly RStudio, but we will start off with concepts learned in ACC3003, relational databases and excel. You should have experience with relational databases and excel, but if you have forgotten do not worry. We will pick up here and discover how R can push these technologies further. Lets get started with Relational databases.\r\nThis case study is provided by PWC. It was developed for a masters level course, but I am adapting it for our class. I will provide all of the knowledge based content because it is important to get an understanding of what accounting firms are looking for, but we may only discuss portions in class.\r\nLets Get Started\r\nModule 1 Objectives\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of relational databases, data lineage, and ERP systems\r\nDemonstrate how to interpret an entity relationship diagram\r\nDemonstrate how to use SQL to transform and analyze data\r\nReview\r\nData Analytics Process\r\n\r\nWhat is a Relational Database\r\nA relational database is a collection of data that organizes data in tables and maintains relationships between the tables for information retrieval\r\nA relational database management system (RDBMS) is computer software that enables users to create, modify, and analyze data in a relational database\r\nEnterprise RDBMS include:\r\nMicrosoft SQL Server\r\nOracle Database\r\nOracle MySQL\r\nIBM DB2\r\nSAP Sybase\r\nTeradata\r\nPostgreSQL\r\nLightweight RDBMS include:\r\nMicrosoft Access\r\nSQLite (what we are using 😏)\r\nKey Terms\r\nA table is the basic unit of data storage in a database. Data is stored in rows and columns. You can specify rules for each column of a table like establishing its data type, forcing a column to contain a value in every row, or ensuring unique records\r\nA view is a tailored presentation of data selected from one or more tables, possibly including other views. A view contains no actual data but rather derives what it shows from the tables and views on which it is based. Therefore, a view can be thought of as a virtual table\r\nA schema is a “container” within a database similar to a directory on a file system that groups tables together\r\nThe connection between tables is made by a Primary Key – Foreign Key pair, where the Foreign Key in a table is the Primary Key of another table\r\nA query is used to create, manipulate, or view database objects\r\nA report is formatted view of data from the database within user-defined parameters, often generated in an external file format such as.txt\r\nTables\r\nTables consist of one or more records or rows of data\r\nThe data for each row is organized into a defined set of attributes, organized into columns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData types include:\r\nString/Text/Character\r\nNumeric (Integer, Float)\r\nDate/Time\r\nBoolean (Yes/No, True/False)\r\n\r\n\r\nRelational Tables\r\n\r\nPrimary Key\r\nPrimary key is a unique identifier of records in a table\r\nPrimary key values may be generated manually or automatically\r\nA primary key can consist of more than one field\r\nRelationship Types\r\nOne-to-One\r\nEach instance of one entity relates to only one instance of the second\r\nNot frequently used in database systems\r\nMight use to divide a table with many fields in order to isolate part of a table\r\nOne-to-Many\r\nEach instance of one entity relates to one or more instances of the second entity\r\nMost common type of relationship and it is used to relate one record from the ‘primary’ table with many records in the ‘related’ table.\r\nIn a one-to-many relationship, a record (‘parent’) in Table A can have many matching records (‘children’) in Table B, but a record (‘child’) in Table B has only one matching record (‘parent’) in Table A.\r\nMany-to-Many\r\nMultiple instances of one entity relate to multiple instances of the second entity\r\nEntity Relationship Diagram\r\n\r\nOther Information in PWC Case Study\r\nStructured Query Language\r\nWhat is SQL\r\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is the programming language used when interacting with data in a relational database\r\nSQL implementations for different databases may have minor differences in functions and syntax\r\nSQL statements can be categorized into two groups: Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)\r\nDDL statements are used to create and/or alter table structures in a SQL Server database\r\nDML statements are used to add, modify, query, or remove data from a SQL Server database\r\nSQL Basics\r\nA statement is a complete sequence of functions, keywords, operators, and values that can be evaluated by the database engine\r\nA query returns records from one or more tables in the database\r\nA clause is a component of a statement or query\r\nAn expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a value\r\nExtra white space (spaces, new lines, etc.) is not evaluated\r\nSQL is typically case-insensitive, but functions are capitalized by convention\r\nSQL statements are often required to end with a semi-colon (;)\r\nSQLite and DB Browser for SQLite\r\nwww.sqlite.org:\r\n“SQLite is a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine”\r\n“SQLite is the most used database engine in the world”\r\nsqlitebrowser.org:\r\n“DB Browser for SQLite [DB4S] is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite”\r\nCreate, define, modify and delete tables\r\nBrowse, edit, add and delete records\r\nSearch records\r\nImport and export tables from/to CSV files\r\nIssue SQL queries and inspect the results\r\nSQLite/DB4S Basics\r\n\r\nComments\r\nAdding comments is a best practice when writing code, in any programming language\r\nThese statements are not evaluated by the SQL engine but help the reader understand the intent and the approach behind an individual line of code or the script as a whole\r\nIn SQL, single-line comments are generally preceded by a double dash (“–”), while block comments across multiple lines are marked by “/* … */”\r\n\r\nChinook Sample Database\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinook is a digital media store with several employees\r\nCustomers can buy individual tracks from a variety of musical artists\r\nThe database contains master and transactional data for the business\r\nDownload the database and open the Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite file in DB4S\r\n\r\nSYNTAX\r\nSELECT statement\r\nA SELECT statement is used to fetch records from a database table in the form of a table called a result set\r\nOne or more columns may be specified, or the asterisk (*) can be used to return all records from the table\r\nUse the LIMIT keyword to return only the first n rows from the result set\r\nThe result set is not stored in the database without the use of additional functions\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT *  FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{LIMIT}}\\) 5\r\nCREATE TABLE statement\r\nA CREATE TABLE statement is used to add the result set from a query to the database as a new table\r\nComplicated queries can be broken down by creating intermediate tables\r\nThe ability to create a table depends on the level of access granted to a user, so it may not be possible in some situations\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{CREATE TABLE}}\\) new_table \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nORDER BY\r\nThe \\(\\color{red}{\\text{ORDER BY}}\\) keyword can be added to a SELECT statement to sort the records\r\nThe typical default order is ascending (ASC), but you can also specify descending (DESC)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{ORDER BY}}\\) column2, column1, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{DESC}}\\)\r\nCOUNT\r\nThe COUNT function returns the number of records in the result set\r\nThe input parameter can be * or 1\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) COUNT(*) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) COUNT(1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nExercise #1\r\nAnswer the following questions using the Chinook Database in DB Browser \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(Do not peek at the answers 👿 )}}\\):\r\nHow many columns does the customer table have?1\r\nAnswer 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer

2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE clause\r\nThe WHERE clause can be added to a SELECT statement to filter records that meet certain conditions, i.e. return a subset of the table\r\nWe use expressions to define these conditions\r\nMost conditional operators are self-explanatory (=, <, >, etc.)\r\nA common operator for “not equals” is <> or !=\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) column1 = ‘ABC’\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\)

less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true\r\n(a < b) is true\r\nAND/OR\r\nAn AND/OR operator can be added to a WHERE clause to filter records on based on multiple conditions\r\nThe AND operator returns all records where both conditions are true\r\nThe OR operator returns all records if either the first condition or the second condition are true\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) a_condition \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AND}}\\)

2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpressions\r\nAn expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluates to a value\r\nAny time the data must be displayed, filtered, or ordered in a way that is different from how it is stored, you can use expressions and functions to manipulate it\r\nWe can use expressions to create calculated or derived fields, as in the example below:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{end_bal}}\\) – \\(\\color{red}{\\text{beg_bal}}\\) is the expression\r\nMinus (\\(\\color{red}{\\text{-}}\\)) is an operator\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{end_bal}}\\) and \\(\\color{red}{\\text{beg_bal}}\\) are columns in the existing table\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS \"difference\"}}\\) provides a name for a new column in the result set\r\n\r\nSELECT column1, end_bal, end_bal – beg_bal \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) “difference”\r\nFROM table_name\r\nArithmetic operators\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Operator}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Description}}\\)\r\n+\r\nAdds values on either side of the operator\r\n-\r\nSubtracts right hand operand from left hand operand\r\n*\r\nMultiplies values on either side of the operator\r\n/\r\nDivides left hand operand by right hand operand\r\n%\r\nDivides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder (“modulus”)\r\nString functions\r\nThe RTRIM and LTRIM functions remove spaces from the right side or left side of a string\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{RTRIM(<string>)}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{LTRIM(<string>)}}\\)\r\nUse SUBSTR to return a portion of a string starting at a given position and for a specified number of characters\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SUBSTR(<string>,<start location>,<length>)}}\\)\r\nUse LENGTH to return the number of characters in a string (other SQL implementations may use LEN)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{LENGTH(<string>)}}\\)\r\nString functions (continued)\r\nUse UPPER and LOWER to change a string to either uppercase or lowercase\r\nYou may need to display all uppercase data in a report, for example\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{UPPER(<string>)}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{LOWER(<string>)}}\\)\r\nUse REPLACE to substitute one string value for another\r\nUse REPLACE to clean up data; for example, you may need to replace slashes (/) in a phone number column with hyphens (-) for a report\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{REPLACE(<string value>,<string to replace>,<replacement>) }}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{REPLACE}}\\) (column1, ‘/’, ‘-’) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nNumeric functions\r\nUse ROUND to specify a number of significant digits:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{ROUND}}\\) (column1, 2) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nUse RANDOM in combination with the absolute value function ABS and modulus operator % to generate a random number on a specific range:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) *, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{ABS}}\\)(\\(\\color{red}{\\text{RANDOM}}\\)() % 100) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nData functions\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent SQL implementations have varying functions and operators for dates and times\r\nIn SQLite, date objects are created by DATE and related functions, and arithmetic operators are used to do calculations involving dates\r\nDATE(‘now’) returns the current date and time of the server\r\nJULIANDAY interprets dates in the standard YYYY-MM-DD format\r\nSTRFTIME provides flexible options for managing dates and times using substitutions shown at right\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Sub}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Description}}\\)\r\n%d\r\nday of month: 00\r\n%f\r\nfractional seconds: SS.SSS\r\n%H\r\nhour: 00-24\r\n%j\r\nday of year:

\\(\\color{red}{\\text{JULIANDAY}}\\)(‘1776-07-04’);\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{STRFTIME}}\\)(‘%Y-%m-%d’, column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{STRFTIME}}\\)(‘%w’, column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{STRFTIME}}\\)(‘%W’, column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nCAST\r\nThe CAST function is used for explicitly changing the data type of a column, often from text to numeric and vice versa\r\nAvailable data types include:\r\nINT - Integer\r\nCHAR - Text\r\nTEXT - Text\r\nREAL - Numeric\r\nFLOAT - Numeric\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{CAST}}\\)(column1

old was the oldest employee when they were hired?\r\nAnswer 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTINCT\r\nThe DISTINCT function returns the unique values in a column or unique records across multiple columns\r\nThe combination of COUNT and DISTINCT returns the number of unique values\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT DISTINCT}}\\) column1 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT COUNT}}\\)(\\(\\color{red}{\\text{DISTINCT}}\\) column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nAggregate functions\r\nThe following functions, including COUNT, calculate totals or statistics by column\r\nThese statistics can apply to all rows or groupings of rows using GROUP BY\r\nOther SQL implementations may include additional statistics (standard deviation, variance, median, etc.)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Function}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Description}}\\)\r\nCOUNT()\r\nCounts the total number of records\r\nSUM()\r\nSum of numeric values\r\nAVG()\r\nFinds the average\r\nMIN()\r\nReturns the smallest number\r\nMAX()\r\nReturns the largest number\r\nGROUP BY clause\r\nThe SQL GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to aggregate by groups (similar to Excel’s pivot table).\r\nThe GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause and precedes the ORDER BY clause (if present)\r\nThis clause regularly makes use of SQL’s aggregate functions; when used with GROUP BY, each aggregate function produces a single value for each group\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, count(1) as ct, sum(column1) as sum1\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) a_condition\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1, column2\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{ORDER BY}}\\) column2, column1\r\nExample - GROUP BY with aggregate function\r\n\r\nHaving clause\r\nThe HAVING clause can be added to GROUP BY to filter records that meet certain conditions, i.e. return a subset of the groupings\r\nOperators are the same as the WHERE clause\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, count(1) as counts \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1, column2 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{HAVING}}\\) counts > 5\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, count(1) as counts, sum(column2) as sum2\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{HAVING}}\\) counts > 1 and sum2 > 10000\r\nCASE\r\nUse the CASE function to evaluate a list of expressions and return the first one that evaluates to true\r\nCASE can be used inside aggregations to generate a statistic (e.g. sum) only for certain records\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2,\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{CASE}}\\) <test expression>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHEN}}\\) <comparison expression1> \\(\\color{red}{\\text{THEN}}\\) <return value1>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHEN}}\\) <comparison expression1> \\(\\color{red}{\\text{THEN}}\\) <return value1>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{ELSE}}\\) <default value>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{END AS}}\\) new_field_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{SUM}}\\)(\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{CASE}}\\) <test expression>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHEN}}\\) <comparison expression1> \\(\\color{red}{\\text{THEN 1 ELSE 0}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{END AS}}\\) new_field_name\r\n) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1\r\nExercise #4\r\nAnswer the following questions using the Chinook Database in DB Browser \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(Do not peek at the answers 👿 )}}\\):\r\nReturn a list of countries by the total value of invoices in descending order.\r\nAnswer 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many invoice

table_b.column3\r\nFROM table_a \\(\\color{red}{\\text{JOIN}}\\) table_b ON \\(\\color{green}{\\text{table_a.column1}}\\) = \\(\\color{green}{\\text{table_b.column1}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{GREEN}{\\text{*KEY*}}\\)\r\nAliases\r\nSQL \\(\\color{green}{\\text{aliases}}\\) are used to temporarily refer to a table or a column by a different name\r\nAliases are commonly used in join clauses to save space and keystrokes\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT Employee.BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, BirthDate FROM HumanResources.Employee INNER JOIN Person.Person ON \\(\\color{orange}{\\text{Employee.}}\\)BusinessEntityID = \\(\\color{orange}{\\text{Person.}}\\)BusinessEntityID\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT

join\r\n\r\nExample - Join with GROUP BY\r\n\r\nCombining queries\r\nSELECT statements can be combined to avoid hard-coding values or creating intermediate tables\r\nIn a simple case, an additional SELECT statement returns a value for use in a condition:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) * \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) column1 >\r\n(\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT AVG}}\\)(column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name);\r\nMore complex queries with multiple layers of nesting may require the use of aliases\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT COUNT}}\\)(*) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) (\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) * \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name

Accountants are the original data scientists1 and their weapon of choice has been excel. A large portion of this class will be using R, BUT I hope to show you that R and Excel can work together. At the very least you will learn how to do everything we see in this module in R and you can decide which tool you want to use. 😏 This case study is provided by PWC. It was developed for a masters level course, but I am adapting it for our class. This should be a Review and I plan to move through this quickly. But, as always, you can slow me down with questions and comments.\r\nModule Objectives\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of data quality concepts\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of key terms and capabilities in Excel\r\nDemonstrate how to use Excel to acquire, transform, analyze, and visualize data\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of leading practices for presenting findings in Excel\r\nWhy excel?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no choice… everybody uses it! - this is the hard truth\r\nEasy-to-use <- debatable 😅\r\nMany different functions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvanced capabilities through add-ins\r\nEasy to explore and manipulate the data\r\nCan present data and analysis together\r\nIntegrated with common desktop applications\r\nBut…\r\nSignificant potential for human error\r\nLimited scalability\r\nKeep it simple and ask the Internet!\r\nKey terms\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Term}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Definition}}\\)\r\nWorkbook\r\nAn Excel file is referred to as a workbook\r\nWorksheet\r\nA single “tab” or “sheet” within a Workbook\r\nCell\r\nThe boxes within the worksheet where information is stored. Cells are referenced by column letters (A, B, C, …) and row numbers (1, 2, 3, …) like a map:\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{A1}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{BX800}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{EEE20}}\\)\r\n\r\nRange\r\nA contiguous set of cells referenced by the top left and bottom right cells, separated by a colon (:):\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{A1:D23}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{BA2:CT8}}\\)\r\n\r\nCell References\r\nExcel formulas can reference different cells\r\nChanges to the referenced cells result in updates to value calculated by the formula\r\n\r\nInputs within functions can be either a single cell reference or a block of cells referred to as a range.\r\nThe two example below provide the same result:\r\n=SUM(C1,C2,C3)\r\nSingle cells selection-\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Use the Ctrl Key}}\\)\r\n\r\n=SUM(C1:C3)\r\nRange selection-\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{use Shift Key or Drag with mouse}}\\)\r\n\r\nNote: should a row be inserted between C1 and C3, then example 1 will still provide the same results, however example two will extend to add 4 cells.\r\nAbsolute cell references\r\nAbsolute referencing is a way of referring to cells within formulas so that once copied, the cell reference remains fixed to a particular cell\r\n\r\nRelative referencing\r\nAs a formula is copied along, the row/column numbers adjust accordingly\r\n\r\nAbsolute referencing\r\nAs a formula is copied along, it continues to refer to the same cell as before\r\nAbsolute cell referencing\r\nWith absolute cell referencing, a dollar sign ($) appears in the cell reference:\r\n=B4 Refers to column B and row 4,\r\nBut this will vary if the formula is copied across a range of cells \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(relative reference)}}\\)\r\n=$B4 Will always refer to column B, but row reference can vary\r\n=B$4 Will always refer to row 4, but column reference can vary\r\n=$B$4 Will always refer to column B and row 4\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{(absolute reference)}}\\)\r\nKeyboard shortcut F4 cycles through the four absolute cell reference options\r\nFormulas\r\nExcel calculations are specified with formulas in each cell\r\nTo create a formula, type an equals sign (=) followed by the function and required arguments\r\nOrder of Operations\r\n\r\n\r\nBrackets\r\n( )\r\nExponent\r\n^\r\nDivision/Multiplication\r\n/ *\r\nAddition/Subtraction\r\n+ -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctions\r\nThe fx button to the left of the formula bar opens a list of all available functions\r\n\r\nArguments\r\nFunctions take zero or more inputs or arguments\r\n=FUNCTION(Input1,Input2,…)\r\nArguments can be:\r\nValues\r\n1, 2, 3 or 1.2, 3.6, 2.1 or “x”, “y”, “z” or TRUE, FALSE\r\nCell References\r\nB91, A452, C3\r\n\r\nNavigation shortcuts (Windows)\r\nCtrl + ➡️(⬅️,⬆️,⬇️)\r\nnavigate to the last non-empty cell in that direction\r\nCtrl + Shift + ➡️(⬅️,⬆️,⬇️)\r\nselect a block of cells to last non-empty cell in that direction\r\nCtrl + Space\r\nselect the entire column of the cell you have selected\r\nShift + Space\r\nselect the entire row of the cell you have selected\r\nAcquire data\r\nGetting data into excel\r\nExcel files have the extension .xlsx or .xls (older versions)\r\nExcel can also import data from delimited text files\r\nSome comma-separated values files can be opened directly by Excel\r\nTab-separated values can be copy-and-pasted directly into an Excel worksheet\r\nDelimited text can also be copy-and-pasted into Excel and then separated with text-to-columns\r\n\r\n\r\nExample - Delimited text\r\n\r\nText to columns\r\nYou might have text in one column that should be split across multiple columns, such as “1-Q-Fred” in the example below\r\nYou can use the “Text to Columns” wizard to accomplish this\r\n\r\nFollow the steps prompted when clicking the icon in the Data tab. You can specify:\r\nWhether the separation point is defined by a certain character (Delimited) or at a fixed point in the cell (Fixed Width).\r\nWhat character separates the information\r\nWhere you would like the newly separated information to go.\r\n\r\nReferences to worksheets and workbooks\r\nYou can also use data from other worksheets or other workbooks in your formulas\r\nAnother worksheet in the same workbook is represented by “Sheet!”\r\nA worksheet in a different workbook is represented by “[Workbook.xlsx]Sheet!”\r\n\r\nSample spreadsheet\r\n\r\nSorting\r\nHighlight a range and use the Sort option to order records by one or more columns\r\nMake sure to select an entire table to avoid sorting only part of it\r\n\r\nFilters\r\nFiltering allows you to hide rows in a range if they don’t match select criteria\r\nHighlight the range and click the “Filter” button\r\n\r\nCustom filters\r\nCustom filters allow you to use multiple criteria such as AND or OR\r\nClick on drop down arrow\r\nClick “Text Filters”\r\nChoose Custom\r\n\r\nSummary statistics\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT() - Counts numbers\r\nCOUNTBLANK() - Counts empty cells\r\nCOUNTA() - Counts non-empty cells\r\nMIN() - Returns minimum\r\nMAX() - Returns maximum\r\nAVERAGE() - Returns average/mean\r\nROWS/COLUMNS() - Return number of rows/columns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus Bar\r\nHighlighting a range of cells returns summary statistics on the status bar in the lower right corner\r\nThis is a quick way to get information about part of your data\r\n\r\nCan we rely on the data?\r\n\r\nData quality dimensions\r\n\r\nExercise - Data quality dimensions\r\nIdentify which of the six DQ dimensions applies to the issues described below \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(please do not peek at the answers 😈)}}\\):\r\n‘Gender’ field has the special characters like ~!@#$%^*();\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Validity\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘First name’ is blank or Null\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Completeness\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Last name’ field has only designators such as LLP, LLC, Mr., Mrs., etc\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Accuracy\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Address’ field has only numbers\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Validity\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Account Type’ field does not have pre-defined list of values\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Consistency\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Account Number’ field have duplicate values\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Integrity\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Forex rate’ field does not have up to date exchange rate\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Timeliness\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise - Excel #1\r\nLoad the data from ‘payroll_data.txt’ and ‘reference_data.txt’ into two tabs in an Excel spreadsheet and save it as ‘Payroll Data_<NETID>.xlsx’ \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(please do not peek at the answers)😈}}\\) :\r\nHow did you import the data?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many rows are there?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"payroll_data = 202 rows including header\"  \r\n[2] \"reference_data = 199 rows including header\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many columns?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"payroll_data = 9 columns\"    \"reference_data = 3 columns*\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the average salary?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many missing values are in each column?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat potential data quality issues do you find?

operators\r\n=AND(\\(\\color{darkred}{\\text{logical1}}\\), \\(\\color{red}{\\text{logical2}}\\), …) Gives True if all the conditions are met\r\n=OR(\\(\\color{darkred}{\\text{logical1}}\\), \\(\\color{red}{\\text{logical2}}\\), …) Gives True if at least one condition is met\r\n=NOT(\\(\\color{darkred}{\\text{logical}}\\)) Gives True if the condition is not met\r\n\r\nVLOOKUP\r\nOften we need to add data from one table to another. This requires one column in each table to act as the link between them\r\nVLOOKUP searches vertically down the left-hand column of a table to find a match, then returns the corresponding value from a specified column of the table\r\nIn most cases, the fourth argument should be ‘FALSE’ to require exact matches\r\nAlways use absolute cell references to specify the range containing the lookup data\r\n\r\nUnique values and duplicates\r\nExcel has an option to reduce a single column to its unique values\r\nThis option can also remove duplicate rows from a table across multiple columns\r\n\r\nFind/Replace\r\nYou may need to find or replace values across a worksheet or workbook, which would be time-consuming if done manually\r\nUse Find/Replace to do this efficiently:\r\nCtrl + F: find\r\nCtrl + H: replace\r\n\r\nExcel will search the whole worksheet (or workbook) unless a range is selected\r\nThe “Options >>” button enables the use of requirements such as “Match case”\r\n\r\nExercise Excel #2\r\nIn ‘Payroll Data_<NETID>.xlsx’ \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(please do not peek at the answers)😈}}\\) :\r\nAddress any data quality issues identified previously.\r\nCreate a new column with total compensation (salary plus overtime pay)… what is the average total compensation?\r\nAdd a column for the employee’s tenure at the company in years.\r\nIt turns out that all of the NJ employees work for separate division called “Tasty New Jersey”. Correct the Division column with this information.\r\nCreate a binary column (0/1) that identifies employees of the “Tasty” operating units.\r\nAdd columns for Job Position and Gender from the ‘Reference Data’ worksheet.\r\nSelect a random 5% sample of employees to receive a survey.\r\n\r\nin my opinion 😄↩︎\r\n",
