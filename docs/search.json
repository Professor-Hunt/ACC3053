R lends itself well to business because of its depth of topic-specific packages and its communication infrastructure. R has packages covering a wide range of topics such as econometrics, finance, and time series. R has best-in-class tools for visualization, reporting, and interactivity, which are as important to business as they are to science. Because of this, R is well-suited for scientists, engineers and business professionals.1\r\nThere are plenty of advantages of using R instead of other software packages…\r\nComplete statistical environment and programming language\r\nR integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically. R code is great for reproducibility. Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.\r\nEfficient functions and data structures for data analysis\r\nR is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient. R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web. The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you.\r\nPowerful graphics\r\nThe plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.\r\nAccess to fast growing number of analysis packages\r\nWith 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more. R has a large and welcoming community. Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, or on the RStudio community.\r\nTechnical advantages: free, open-source, available for all OSs\r\nAnyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.\r\nIt’s easy to get distracted by Tableau and PowerBI’s visuals, but when it comes to making business decisions, your organization needs to be able to take actions. This is where R is lightyears ahead of the other tools.\r\nbusiness-science\r\nTools like Excel and tableau are easier to learn, but have a lower Business Capability. R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing. The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands. So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again. Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes. Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.2\r\nExcel is still relevant\r\nExcel is still the most widely used analysis tool in business. Every accountant will use excel.\r\nThen why learn anything else? See above. Also, we will learn to use excel and R together.\r\nDB Browser for SQLite\r\nDB Browser for SQLite3 (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.\r\nDB4S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit databases. DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.\r\nControls and wizards are available for users to:\r\nCreate and compact database files\r\nCreate, define, modify and delete tables\r\nCreate, define, and delete indexes\r\nBrowse, edit, add, and delete records\r\nSearch records\r\nImport and export records as text\r\nImport and export tables from/to CSV files\r\nImport and export databases from/to SQL dump files\r\nIssue SQL queries and inspect the results\r\nExamine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application\r\nPlot simple graphs based on table or query data\r\nDatabases have a very large place in businesses. Accountants will interact with databases or data retrieved from a database. Large companies cannot exist without databases.\r\nWhat is Data Analytics?\r\nA buzz word for sure. But it is becoming more clear everyday. Analytics is the process which will help you to make meaningful conclusions. A lot of industries have recognized the potential that big data and analytics provide. One such industry where we can see the significant potential is the Accounting world.\r\nThe data that exists is scattered, often unused until it is pulled for an audit or a tax return. There was a time when only samples were selected and verified during an audit but now with the advent of Data Analytics auditors are able to analyze the business 24*7.\r\nTo understand the changing customer behavior and market trends Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and finance leaders are embracing accounting software equipped with “Big data” and analytic techniques. The predictive power of data analytics enables CFO’s to make financial decisions based not on what happened in the past but what is likely to happen in the future.\r\nSo why is data analytics so important in accounting?\r\nAccountants use accounting software empowered with data analytics to help businesses uncover the most valuable insights associated with finance, identify process improvements that can increase efficiency and better manage risks. Data analytics gives them the necessary tool-set to strengthen their partnership with business leaders.\r\nA few examples\r\nAuditors who are working both externally and internally can shift from a sample based model to model that allows continuous monitoring where larger data sets can be analyzed and verified. The outcome is less margin of error and more precise recommendations.\r\nTax accountants can also use data science to quickly analyze complex taxation questions related to investment scenarios.\r\nAccountants use big data to study the consumer behavioral patterns. These help businesses build analytic models which can help them identify investment opportunities and generate higher profit margins.\r\nFour Types of Data Analytics every accountant should be aware of\r\n1- Descriptive Analytics = “What happening?”\r\nThis one is used most often and includes classification and categorization of information. Accountants keep an eagle eye on the flow of money through their organization – they take care of the revenue and expenses, inventory counts and sales tax collected. Accurate generation is a trademark of solid accounting practices and for this accurate report generation compiling and verifying large amounts of data is important.\r\n2- Diagnostic Analytics = “Why did it happen?”\r\nDiagnostic is primarily used to monitor the changes in the data. Accountants on daily basis analyze the variances in the data and calculate the historical performance. A lot of accountants use variance analysis for budgeting. There is also specialized accounting software available in the market that can be used for detecting high-risk transactions.\r\n3- Predictive Analytics = “What’s likely to happen”?\r\nIn the predictive analysis, data is used to access the likelihood of future outcomes. Accountants are experts in building forecasts and identifying patterns and trends that shape those forecasts.\r\n4- Prescriptive Analysis =“What should we do?”\r\nSimulation and optimization of data are done to answer questions such as “what should we do?” It is something that is not just limited to recommendations and goes beyond that. It is actually executing actions or taking decisions that are right for a particular situation. The prescriptive analysis is used to answer\" What steps or interventions need to be taken to achieve the required outcome?\"\r\nDescriptive and diagnostic analytics usually depend on analytics tools that have the capacity to handle the manipulation of large sets of data. Examples include SQL, Oracle DB, Hadoop, Tableau, Microsoft Access, R, python etc.\r\nPredictive and Prescriptive analysis rely on analytics tools that have mathematical modeling capabilities. Examples include SAS, R, Python, optimization tools like Garrobi, Riverlogic; simulation tools like Analogic, natural Language processing tools like Natural Language Toolkit or OpenNLP.\r\nThe Future\r\nIt is expected that in the coming years there will be a tremendous use of analytic tools. Accounting professionals will delve themselves deeper into the combined analysis of structured data such as financial statements and unstructured data such as the large volume of client contracts. They will provide more extensive data analytics and quality business insights.\r\nMachine learning, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, blockchain will have a major impact on the profession. But the fact also cannot be denied that “all these technologies in one or another way depends on data”. If you can’t analyze data you cannot do machine learning, you cannot do robotics and you cannot do blockchain.\r\nTherefore it is important that the accountants to take a deep dive into the pool of data and enable themselves to ask better questions and get better answers.\r\nTo make the most out of data analytics such that it suits the needs of the accountants as well as the organization, a clear plan should be carved out that articulates the three components parts- data, analytics, and people. All the three components should be integrated and aligned to create business value.4\r\nAnother good Article\r\nData Analytics in Accounting\r\nLets look at some examples (in no particular order)\r\nDeloitte\r\nKPMG\r\nEY\r\nPWC\r\nHow Can Data Analytics be Helpful to Accountants?\r\nGiven the information above what examples did you see?\r\nTo be turned in:\r\nsubmit a brief summary of what you believe data analytics is and how you think that it might be useful to accountants.\r\n\r\nSEE CANVAS FOR ASSIGNMENT DETAILS\r\n\r\nInstall/update R and RStudio5\r\nR and RStudio are two separate pieces of software:\r\nR is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis\r\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R.\r\nIf you don’t already have R and RStudio installed, follow the instructions for your operating system below. You have to install R before you install RStudio.\r\nWindows\r\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\r\nRun the .exe file that was just downloaded\r\nGo to the RStudio download page\r\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows Vista/7/8/10 (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\r\nDouble click the file to install it\r\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\r\nMacOS\r\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\r\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\r\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\r\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\r\nGo to the RStudio download page\r\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit) (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\r\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\r\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\r\nUpdate R and RStudio\r\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed, check if your R and RStudio are up to date:\r\nWhen you open RStudio your R version will be printed in the console on the bottom left. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo() into the console. If your R version is 4.0.0 or later, you don’t need to update R for this lesson. If your version of R is older than that, download and install the latest version of R from the R project website for Windows, for MacOS, or for Linux\r\nTo update RStudio to the latest version, open RStudio and click on Help\" > Check for updates. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, follow the instruction on screen.\r\nNote: It is not necessary to remove old versions of R from your system, but if you wish to do so you can check How do I uninstall R?\r\nInstall DB Browser\r\nDownload DB Browser for SQLite from their website\r\nSelect the appropriate download for your respective operating system Windows or MacOS (which you should know given the steps above).\r\nMSSTATE ITS Provides Microsoft Excel if you do not have it. I believe they have it available for windows/macOS\r\nLayout of Technology\r\nRStudio\r\nR vs RstudioRStudioRStudio PanesIf you are interested in customizing your RStudio GUI see this article.\r\nDB Browser\r\nDB BrowserDB Browser SQL\r\nhttps://www.business-science.io/business/2020/12/17/six-reasons-to-use-R-for-business-2021.html↩︎\r\nhttps://www.mle.hamburg/_repos/dat_sci/00_preface/↩︎\r\nhttps://sqlitebrowser.org/↩︎\r\nThings you Should Know About Data Analytics in Accounting – StartupGuys.net↩︎\r\nhttps://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#Install_R_and_RStudio↩︎\r\n",

We are going to learn the basics ETL using mostly RStudio, but we will start off with concepts learned in ACC3003, relational databases and excel. You should have experience with relational databases and excel, but if you have forgotten do not worry. We will pick up here and discover how R can push these technologies further. Lets get started with Relational databases.\r\nThis case study is provided by PWC. It was developed for a masters level course, but I am adapting it for our class. I will provide all of the knowledge based content because it is important to get an understanding of what accounting firms are looking for, but we may only discuss portions in class.\r\nLets Get Started\r\nModule 1 Objectives\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of relational databases, data lineage, and ERP systems\r\nDemonstrate how to interpret an entity relationship diagram\r\nDemonstrate how to use SQL to transform and analyze data\r\nReview\r\nData Analytics Process\r\n\r\nWhat is a Relational Database\r\nA relational database is a collection of data that organizes data in tables and maintains relationships between the tables for information retrieval\r\nA relational database management system (RDBMS) is computer software that enables users to create, modify, and analyze data in a relational database\r\nEnterprise RDBMS include:\r\nMicrosoft SQL Server\r\nOracle Database\r\nOracle MySQL\r\nIBM DB2\r\nSAP Sybase\r\nTeradata\r\nPostgreSQL\r\nLightweight RDBMS include:\r\nMicrosoft Access\r\nSQLite (what we are using 😏)\r\nKey Terms\r\nA table is the basic unit of data storage in a database. Data is stored in rows and columns. You can specify rules for each column of a table like establishing its data type, forcing a column to contain a value in every row, or ensuring unique records\r\nA view is a tailored presentation of data selected from one or more tables, possibly including other views. A view contains no actual data but rather derives what it shows from the tables and views on which it is based. Therefore, a view can be thought of as a virtual table\r\nA schema is a “container” within a database similar to a directory on a file system that groups tables together\r\nThe connection between tables is made by a Primary Key – Foreign Key pair, where the Foreign Key in a table is the Primary Key of another table\r\nA query is used to create, manipulate, or view database objects\r\nA report is formatted view of data from the database within user-defined parameters, often generated in an external file format such as.txt\r\nTables\r\nTables consist of one or more records or rows of data\r\nThe data for each row is organized into a defined set of attributes, organized into columns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData types include:\r\nString/Text/Character\r\nNumeric (Integer, Float)\r\nDate/Time\r\nBoolean (Yes/No, True/False)\r\n\r\n\r\nRelational Tables\r\n\r\nPrimary Key\r\nPrimary key is a unique identifier of records in a table\r\nPrimary key values may be generated manually or automatically\r\nA primary key can consist of more than one field\r\nRelationship Types\r\nOne-to-One\r\nEach instance of one entity relates to only one instance of the second\r\nNot frequently used in database systems\r\nMight use to divide a table with many fields in order to isolate part of a table\r\nOne-to-Many\r\nEach instance of one entity relates to one or more instances of the second entity\r\nMost common type of relationship and it is used to relate one record from the ‘primary’ table with many records in the ‘related’ table.\r\nIn a one-to-many relationship, a record (‘parent’) in Table A can have many matching records (‘children’) in Table B, but a record (‘child’) in Table B has only one matching record (‘parent’) in Table A.\r\nMany-to-Many\r\nMultiple instances of one entity relate to multiple instances of the second entity\r\nEntity Relationship Diagram\r\n\r\nOther Information in PWC Case Study\r\nStructured Query Language\r\nWhat is SQL\r\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is the programming language used when interacting with data in a relational database\r\nSQL implementations for different databases may have minor differences in functions and syntax\r\nSQL statements can be categorized into two groups: Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)\r\nDDL statements are used to create and/or alter table structures in a SQL Server database\r\nDML statements are used to add, modify, query, or remove data from a SQL Server database\r\nSQL Basics\r\nA statement is a complete sequence of functions, keywords, operators, and values that can be evaluated by the database engine\r\nA query returns records from one or more tables in the database\r\nA clause is a component of a statement or query\r\nAn expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a value\r\nExtra white space (spaces, new lines, etc.) is not evaluated\r\nSQL is typically case-insensitive, but functions are capitalized by convention\r\nSQL statements are often required to end with a semi-colon (;)\r\nSQLite and DB Browser for SQLite\r\nwww.sqlite.org:\r\n“SQLite is a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine”\r\n“SQLite is the most used database engine in the world”\r\nsqlitebrowser.org:\r\n“DB Browser for SQLite [DB4S] is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite”\r\nCreate, define, modify and delete tables\r\nBrowse, edit, add and delete records\r\nSearch records\r\nImport and export tables from/to CSV files\r\nIssue SQL queries and inspect the results\r\nSQLite/DB4S Basics\r\n\r\nComments\r\nAdding comments is a best practice when writing code, in any programming language\r\nThese statements are not evaluated by the SQL engine but help the reader understand the intent and the approach behind an individual line of code or the script as a whole\r\nIn SQL, single-line comments are generally preceded by a double dash (“–”), while block comments across multiple lines are marked by “/* … */”\r\n\r\nChinook Sample Database\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinook is a digital media store with several employees\r\nCustomers can buy individual tracks from a variety of musical artists\r\nThe database contains master and transactional data for the business\r\nDownload the database and open the Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite file in DB4S\r\n\r\nSYNTAX\r\nSELECT statement\r\nA SELECT statement is used to fetch records from a database table in the form of a table called a result set\r\nOne or more columns may be specified, or the asterisk (*) can be used to return all records from the table\r\nUse the LIMIT keyword to return only the first n rows from the result set\r\nThe result set is not stored in the database without the use of additional functions\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT *  FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{LIMIT}}\\) 5\r\nCREATE TABLE statement\r\nA CREATE TABLE statement is used to add the result set from a query to the database as a new table\r\nComplicated queries can be broken down by creating intermediate tables\r\nThe ability to create a table depends on the level of access granted to a user, so it may not be possible in some situations\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{CREATE TABLE}}\\) new_table \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nORDER BY\r\nThe \\(\\color{red}{\\text{ORDER BY}}\\) keyword can be added to a SELECT statement to sort the records\r\nThe typical default order is ascending (ASC), but you can also specify descending (DESC)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{ORDER BY}}\\) column2, column1, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{DESC}}\\)\r\nCOUNT\r\nThe COUNT function returns the number of records in the result set\r\nThe input parameter can be * or 1\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) COUNT(*) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) COUNT(1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nExercise #1\r\nAnswer the following questions using the Chinook Database in DB Browser \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(Do not peek at the answers 👿 )}}\\):\r\nHow many columns does the customer table have?1\r\nAnswer 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer

define these conditions\r\nMost conditional operators are self-explanatory (=, <, >, etc.)\r\nA common operator for “not equals” is <> or !=\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) column1 = ‘ABC’\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\)

less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true\r\n(a < b) is true\r\nAND/OR\r\nAn AND/OR operator can be added to a WHERE clause to filter records on based on multiple conditions\r\nThe AND operator returns all records where both conditions are true\r\nThe OR operator returns all records if either the first condition or the second condition are true\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, column3 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) a_condition \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AND}}\\)

2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpressions\r\nAn expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluates to a value\r\nAny time the data must be displayed, filtered, or ordered in a way that is different from how it is stored, you can use expressions and functions to manipulate it\r\nWe can use expressions to create calculated or derived fields, as in the example below:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{end_bal}}\\) – \\(\\color{red}{\\text{beg_bal}}\\) is the expression\r\nMinus (\\(\\color{red}{\\text{-}}\\)) is an operator\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{end_bal}}\\) and \\(\\color{red}{\\text{beg_bal}}\\) are columns in the existing table\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS \"difference\"}}\\) provides a name for a new column in the result set\r\n\r\nSELECT column1, end_bal, end_bal – beg_bal \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) “difference”\r\nFROM table_name\r\nArithmetic operators\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Operator}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Description}}\\)\r\n+\r\nAdds values on either side of the operator\r\n-\r\nSubtracts right hand operand from left hand operand\r\n*\r\nMultiplies values on either side of the operator\r\n/\r\nDivides left hand operand by right hand operand\r\n%\r\nDivides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder (“modulus”)\r\nString functions\r\nThe RTRIM and LTRIM functions remove spaces from the right side or left side of a string\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{RTRIM(<string>)}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{LTRIM(<string>)}}\\)\r\nUse SUBSTR to return a portion of a string starting at a given position and for a specified number of characters\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SUBSTR(<string>,<start location>,<length>)}}\\)\r\nUse LENGTH to return the number of characters in a string (other SQL implementations may use LEN)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{LENGTH(<string>)}}\\)\r\nString functions (continued)\r\nUse UPPER and LOWER to change a string to either uppercase or lowercase\r\nYou may need to display all uppercase data in a report, for example\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{UPPER(<string>)}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{LOWER(<string>)}}\\)\r\nUse REPLACE to substitute one string value for another\r\nUse REPLACE to clean up data; for example, you may need to replace slashes (/) in a phone number column with hyphens (-) for a report\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{REPLACE(<string value>,<string to replace>,<replacement>) }}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{REPLACE}}\\) (column1, ‘/’, ‘-’) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nNumeric functions\r\nUse ROUND to specify a number of significant digits:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{ROUND}}\\) (column1, 2) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nUse RANDOM in combination with the absolute value function ABS and modulus operator % to generate a random number on a specific range:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) *, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{ABS}}\\)(\\(\\color{red}{\\text{RANDOM}}\\)() % 100) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nData functions\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent SQL implementations have varying functions and operators for dates and times\r\nIn SQLite, date objects are created by DATE and related functions, and arithmetic operators are used to do calculations involving dates\r\nDATE(‘now’) returns the current date and time of the server\r\nJULIANDAY interprets dates in the standard YYYY-MM-DD format\r\nSTRFTIME provides flexible options for managing dates and times using substitutions shown at right\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Sub}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Description}}\\)\r\n%d\r\nday of month: 00\r\n%f\r\nfractional seconds: SS.SSS\r\n%H\r\nhour: 00-24\r\n%j\r\nday of year:

\\(\\color{red}{\\text{JULIANDAY}}\\)(‘1776-07-04’);\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{STRFTIME}}\\)(‘%Y-%m-%d’, column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{STRFTIME}}\\)(‘%w’, column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{STRFTIME}}\\)(‘%W’, column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) new_col\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nCAST\r\nThe CAST function is used for explicitly changing the data type of a column, often from text to numeric and vice versa\r\nAvailable data types include:\r\nINT - Integer\r\nCHAR - Text\r\nTEXT - Text\r\nREAL - Numeric\r\nFLOAT - Numeric\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{CAST}}\\)(column1 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS INT}}\\)) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) int_col \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column2, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{CAST}}\\)(column2 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS CHAR}}\\)) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{AS}}\\) char_col \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nExercise #3\r\nAnswer the following questions using the Chinook Database in DB Browser \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(Do not peek at the answers 👿 )}}\\):\r\nHow many employees does Chinook have?\r\nAnswer 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer

old was the oldest employee when they were hired?\r\nAnswer 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTINCT\r\nThe DISTINCT function returns the unique values in a column or unique records across multiple columns\r\nThe combination of COUNT and DISTINCT returns the number of unique values\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT DISTINCT}}\\) column1 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT COUNT}}\\)(\\(\\color{red}{\\text{DISTINCT}}\\) column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\nAggregate functions\r\nThe following functions, including COUNT, calculate totals or statistics by column\r\nThese statistics can apply to all rows or groupings of rows using GROUP BY\r\nOther SQL implementations may include additional statistics (standard deviation, variance, median, etc.)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Function}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Description}}\\)\r\nCOUNT()\r\nCounts the total number of records\r\nSUM()\r\nSum of numeric values\r\nAVG()\r\nFinds the average\r\nMIN()\r\nReturns the smallest number\r\nMAX()\r\nReturns the largest number\r\nGROUP BY clause\r\nThe SQL GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to aggregate by groups (similar to Excel’s pivot table).\r\nThe GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause and precedes the ORDER BY clause (if present)\r\nThis clause regularly makes use of SQL’s aggregate functions; when used with GROUP BY, each aggregate function produces a single value for each group\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, count(1) as ct, sum(column1) as sum1\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) a_condition\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1, column2\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{ORDER BY}}\\) column2, column1\r\nExample - GROUP BY with aggregate function\r\n\r\nHaving clause\r\nThe HAVING clause can be added to GROUP BY to filter records that meet certain conditions, i.e. return a subset of the groupings\r\nOperators are the same as the WHERE clause\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2, count(1) as counts \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1, column2 \\(\\color{red}{\\text{HAVING}}\\) counts > 5\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, count(1) as counts, sum(column2) as sum2\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{HAVING}}\\) counts > 1 and sum2 > 10000\r\nCASE\r\nUse the CASE function to evaluate a list of expressions and return the first one that evaluates to true\r\nCASE can be used inside aggregations to generate a statistic (e.g. sum) only for certain records\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, column2,\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{CASE}}\\) <test expression>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHEN}}\\) <comparison expression1> \\(\\color{red}{\\text{THEN}}\\) <return value1>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHEN}}\\) <comparison expression1> \\(\\color{red}{\\text{THEN}}\\) <return value1>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{ELSE}}\\) <default value>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{END AS}}\\) new_field_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) column1, \\(\\color{red}{\\text{SUM}}\\)(\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{CASE}}\\) <test expression>\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHEN}}\\) <comparison expression1> \\(\\color{red}{\\text{THEN 1 ELSE 0}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{END AS}}\\) new_field_name\r\n) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{GROUP BY}}\\) column1\r\nExercise #4\r\nAnswer the following questions using the Chinook Database in DB Browser \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(Do not peek at the answers 👿 )}}\\):\r\nReturn a list of countries by the total value of invoices in descending order.\r\nAnswer 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many invoice

table_b.column3\r\nFROM table_a \\(\\color{red}{\\text{JOIN}}\\) table_b ON \\(\\color{green}{\\text{table_a.column1}}\\) = \\(\\color{green}{\\text{table_b.column1}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{GREEN}{\\text{*KEY*}}\\)\r\nAliases\r\nSQL \\(\\color{green}{\\text{aliases}}\\) are used to temporarily refer to a table or a column by a different name\r\nAliases are commonly used in join clauses to save space and keystrokes\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT Employee.BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, BirthDate FROM HumanResources.Employee INNER JOIN Person.Person ON \\(\\color{orange}{\\text{Employee.}}\\)BusinessEntityID = \\(\\color{orange}{\\text{Person.}}\\)BusinessEntityID\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT

join\r\n\r\nExample - Join with GROUP BY\r\n\r\nCombining queries\r\nSELECT statements can be combined to avoid hard-coding values or creating intermediate tables\r\nIn a simple case, an additional SELECT statement returns a value for use in a condition:\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) * \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name \\(\\color{red}{\\text{WHERE}}\\) column1 >\r\n(\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT AVG}}\\)(column1) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name);\r\nMore complex queries with multiple layers of nesting may require the use of aliases\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT COUNT}}\\)(*) \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) (\\(\\color{red}{\\text{SELECT}}\\) * \\(\\color{red}{\\text{FROM}}\\) table_name

Accountants are the original data scientists1 and their weapon of choice has been excel. A large portion of this class will be using R, BUT I hope to show you that R and Excel can work together. At the very least you will learn how to do everything we see in this module in R and you can decide which tool you want to use. 😏 This case study is provided by PWC. It was developed for a masters level course, but I am adapting it for our class. This should be a Review and I plan to move through this quickly. But, as always, you can slow me down with questions and comments.\r\nModule Objectives\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of data quality concepts\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of key terms and capabilities in Excel\r\nDemonstrate how to use Excel to acquire, transform, analyze, and visualize data\r\nDemonstrate knowledge of leading practices for presenting findings in Excel\r\nWhy excel?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no choice… everybody uses it! - this is the hard truth\r\nEasy-to-use <- debatable 😅\r\nMany different functions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvanced capabilities through add-ins\r\nEasy to explore and manipulate the data\r\nCan present data and analysis together\r\nIntegrated with common desktop applications\r\nBut…\r\nSignificant potential for human error\r\nLimited scalability\r\nKeep it simple and ask the Internet!\r\nKey terms\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Term}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Definition}}\\)\r\nWorkbook\r\nAn Excel file is referred to as a workbook\r\nWorksheet\r\nA single “tab” or “sheet” within a Workbook\r\nCell\r\nThe boxes within the worksheet where information is stored. Cells are referenced by column letters (A, B, C, …) and row numbers (1, 2, 3, …) like a map:\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{A1}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{BX800}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{EEE20}}\\)\r\n\r\nRange\r\nA contiguous set of cells referenced by the top left and bottom right cells, separated by a colon (:):\r\n\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{A1:D23}}\\)\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{BA2:CT8}}\\)\r\n\r\nCell References\r\nExcel formulas can reference different cells\r\nChanges to the referenced cells result in updates to value calculated by the formula\r\n\r\nInputs within functions can be either a single cell reference or a block of cells referred to as a range.\r\nThe two example below provide the same result:\r\n=SUM(C1,C2,C3)\r\nSingle cells selection-\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Use the Ctrl Key}}\\)\r\n\r\n=SUM(C1:C3)\r\nRange selection-\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{use Shift Key or Drag with mouse}}\\)\r\n\r\nNote: should a row be inserted between C1 and C3, then example 1 will still provide the same results, however example two will extend to add 4 cells.\r\nAbsolute cell references\r\nAbsolute referencing is a way of referring to cells within formulas so that once copied, the cell reference remains fixed to a particular cell\r\n\r\nRelative referencing\r\nAs a formula is copied along, the row/column numbers adjust accordingly\r\n\r\nAbsolute referencing\r\nAs a formula is copied along, it continues to refer to the same cell as before\r\nAbsolute cell referencing\r\nWith absolute cell referencing, a dollar sign ($) appears in the cell reference:\r\n=B4 Refers to column B and row 4,\r\nBut this will vary if the formula is copied across a range of cells \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(relative reference)}}\\)\r\n=$B4 Will always refer to column B, but row reference can vary\r\n=B$4 Will always refer to row 4, but column reference can vary\r\n=$B$4 Will always refer to column B and row 4\r\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{(absolute reference)}}\\)\r\nKeyboard shortcut F4 cycles through the four absolute cell reference options\r\nFormulas\r\nExcel calculations are specified with formulas in each cell\r\nTo create a formula, type an equals sign (=) followed by the function and required arguments\r\nOrder of Operations\r\n\r\n\r\nBrackets\r\n( )\r\nExponent\r\n^\r\nDivision/Multiplication\r\n/ *\r\nAddition/Subtraction\r\n+ -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctions\r\nThe fx button to the left of the formula bar opens a list of all available functions\r\n\r\nArguments\r\nFunctions take zero or more inputs or arguments\r\n=FUNCTION(Input1,Input2,…)\r\nArguments can be:\r\nValues\r\n1, 2, 3 or 1.2, 3.6, 2.1 or “x”, “y”, “z” or TRUE, FALSE\r\nCell References\r\nB91, A452, C3\r\n\r\nNavigation shortcuts (Windows)\r\nCtrl + ➡️(⬅️,⬆️,⬇️)\r\nnavigate to the last non-empty cell in that direction\r\nCtrl + Shift + ➡️(⬅️,⬆️,⬇️)\r\nselect a block of cells to last non-empty cell in that direction\r\nCtrl + Space\r\nselect the entire column of the cell you have selected\r\nShift + Space\r\nselect the entire row of the cell you have selected\r\nAcquire data\r\nGetting data into excel\r\nExcel files have the extension .xlsx or .xls (older versions)\r\nExcel can also import data from delimited text files\r\nSome comma-separated values files can be opened directly by Excel\r\nTab-separated values can be copy-and-pasted directly into an Excel worksheet\r\nDelimited text can also be copy-and-pasted into Excel and then separated with text-to-columns\r\n\r\n\r\nExample - Delimited text\r\n\r\nText to columns\r\nYou might have text in one column that should be split across multiple columns, such as “1-Q-Fred” in the example below\r\nYou can use the “Text to Columns” wizard to accomplish this\r\n\r\nFollow the steps prompted when clicking the icon in the Data tab. You can specify:\r\nWhether the separation point is defined by a certain character (Delimited) or at a fixed point in the cell (Fixed Width).\r\nWhat character separates the information\r\nWhere you would like the newly separated information to go.\r\n\r\nReferences to worksheets and workbooks\r\nYou can also use data from other worksheets or other workbooks in your formulas\r\nAnother worksheet in the same workbook is represented by “Sheet!”\r\nA worksheet in a different workbook is represented by “[Workbook.xlsx]Sheet!”\r\n\r\nSample spreadsheet\r\n\r\nSorting\r\nHighlight a range and use the Sort option to order records by one or more columns\r\nMake sure to select an entire table to avoid sorting only part of it\r\n\r\nFilters\r\nFiltering allows you to hide rows in a range if they don’t match select criteria\r\nHighlight the range and click the “Filter” button\r\n\r\nCustom filters\r\nCustom filters allow you to use multiple criteria such as AND or OR\r\nClick on drop down arrow\r\nClick “Text Filters”\r\nChoose Custom\r\n\r\nSummary statistics\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT() - Counts numbers\r\nCOUNTBLANK() - Counts empty cells\r\nCOUNTA() - Counts non-empty cells\r\nMIN() - Returns minimum\r\nMAX() - Returns maximum\r\nAVERAGE() - Returns average/mean\r\nROWS/COLUMNS() - Return number of rows/columns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus Bar\r\nHighlighting a range of cells returns summary statistics on the status bar in the lower right corner\r\nThis is a quick way to get information about part of your data\r\n\r\nCan we rely on the data?\r\n\r\nData quality dimensions\r\n\r\nExercise - Data quality dimensions\r\nIdentify which of the six DQ dimensions applies to the issues described below \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(please do not peek at the answers 😈)}}\\):\r\n‘Gender’ field has the special characters like ~!@#$%^*();\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Validity\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘First name’ is blank or Null\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Completeness\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Last name’ field has only designators such as LLP, LLC, Mr., Mrs., etc\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Accuracy\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Address’ field has only numbers\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Validity\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Account Type’ field does not have pre-defined list of values\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Consistency\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Account Number’ field have duplicate values\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Integrity\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Forex rate’ field does not have up to date exchange rate\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Timeliness\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise - Excel #1\r\nLoad the data from ‘payroll_data.txt’ and ‘reference_data.txt’ into two tabs in an Excel spreadsheet and save it as ‘Payroll Data_<NETID>.xlsx’ \\(\\color{red}{\\text{(please do not peek at the answers)😈}}\\) :\r\nHow did you import the data?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many rows are there?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"payroll_data = 202 rows including header\"  \r\n[2] \"reference_data = 199 rows including header\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many columns?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"payroll_data = 9 columns\"    \"reference_data = 3 columns*\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the average salary?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many missing values are in each column?\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat potential data quality issues do you find?

For example I have a folder called “R projects” on my desktop.\r\nNext click file>New Project>New Directory>New Project\r\nBrowse to your desktop folder\r\nName the directory: ACC3053\r\n\r\n\r\nRStudio\r\n\r\nWhat are R Packages?\r\nR packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet.\r\nA good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone:\r\n\r\nSo R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play.\r\nLet’s continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a photo you have just taken with friends on Instagram. You need to:\r\nInstall the app: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you’re set for the time being. You might need to do this again in the future when there is an update to the app.\r\nOpen the app: After you’ve installed Instagram, you need to open it.\r\nOnce Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:\r\nInstall the package: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you’ve installed a package, you likely won’t install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version.\r\n“Load” the package: “Loading” a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not “loaded” by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to “load” each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.\r\nErrors, warnings, and messages\r\nIf the text starts with “Error”, figure out what’s causing it. Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong!\r\nIf the text starts with “Warning”, figure out if it’s something to worry about. For instance, if you get a warning about missing values in a scatterplot and you know there are missing values, you’re fine. If that’s surprising, look at your data and see what’s missing. Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working fine, but watch out/pay attention.\r\nOtherwise, the text is just a message. Read it, wave back at R, and thank it for talking to you. Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine and keep on going!\r\nWhat is RMarkdown?1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nR Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both\r\nsave and execute code\r\ngenerate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience\r\nInstallation\r\nLike the rest of R, R Markdown is free and open source. You can install the R Markdown package from CRAN with:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed rmarkdown you can create a document\r\n\r\nNotice that the file contains three types of content:\r\nAn (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s\r\nR code chunks surrounded by ```s\r\ntext mixed with simple text formatting\r\nYou can run each code chunk by clicking the  icon. RStudio executes the code and display the results inline with your file. \r\nRendering output\r\nTo generate a report from the file, run the render command:\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\nrender(\"1-example.Rmd\")\r\nBetter still, use the “Knit” button in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click. \r\nR Markdown generates a new file that contains selected text, code, and results from the .Rmd file. The new file can be a finished web page, PDF, MS Word document, slide show, notebook, handout, book, dashboard, package vignette or other format.\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nWhen you run render, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output.\r\nThe markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc which is responsible for creating the finished format.\r\nThis may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single render function.\r\nKnowing the details is beyond this class, but the gist is that we can create documents with code and output. The facilitates reproducible reports.\r\nImagine having to generate the same reports each week/month from excel spreadsheets. To some extent you would have to add the formulas that you need to generate the numbers/summary stats you need for the report. BUT if your original report contained the necessary code to generate the desired output all you would have to do is update the data.\r\nCode Chunks\r\nYou can quickly insert chunks like these into your file with\r\nthe keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I) the Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar or by typing the chunk delimiters {r} and.\r\nWhen you render your .Rmd file, R Markdown will run each code chunk and embed the results beneath the code chunk in your final report.\r\nChunk Options\r\nChunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header. Above, we use five arguments:\r\ninclude = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.\r\necho = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.\r\nmessage = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.\r\nwarning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.\r\nfig.cap = \"...\" adds a caption to graphical results.\r\nExercise #1\r\nAnswer the following questions. \\(\\color{red}{\\text{Do not peek at the answers.}}\\)👊\r\nAdd echo=FALSE to the following code in your rmarkdown file what happens?\r\n```{r cars}summary(cars)```\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd include=FALSE to the following code in your rmarkdown file what happens?\r\n```{r cars}summary(cars)```\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd a caption to the following code in your rmarkdown file.\r\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}plot(pressure)```\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the R Markdown Reference Guide for a complete list of knitr chunk options.\r\nGlobal Options\r\nTo set global options that apply to every chunk in your file, call knitr::opts_chunk$set in a code chunk. Knitr will treat each option that you pass to knitr::opts_chunk$set as a global default that can be overwritten in individual chunk headers.\r\nCaching\r\nIf document rendering becomes time consuming due to long computations you can use knitr caching to improve performance. Knitr chunk and package options describes how caching works and the Cache examples provide additional details.\r\nInline Code\r\nCode results can be inserted directly into the text of a .Rmd file by enclosing the code with `r `.\r\ncopy the following code and add it to your default .Rmd file\r\n# Inline Code example\r\n\r\n```{r inline, include=FALSE}\r\ncars_variable<-\"dist\"\r\n#cars_variable<-\"speed\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use the `<-` to store information in objects. \r\n`object <- information`. The above code stores  `r cars_variable`  in cars_variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n```{r select, message=FALSE}\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\ncars%>%\r\n  select(c(paste(cars_variable)))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode Languages\r\nknitr can execute code in many languages besides R. Some of the available language engines include:\r\nPython\r\nSQL\r\nBash\r\nRcpp\r\nStan\r\nJavaScript\r\nCSS\r\nTo process a code chunk using an alternate language engine, replace the r at the start of your chunk declaration with the name of the language. To connect to a data base first connect to the database using R code. See the following example:\r\nCODE\r\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\r\nlibrary(DBI)\r\ndb = dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = \"data/03-Data-file-classroom-exercise-Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite\")\r\n```\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(DBI)\r\ndb = dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = \"data/03-Data-file-classroom-exercise-Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext start your chunk with the declaration of the language. Below is the answer to the first question from the first exercise in module 1.\r\nCODE\r\n```{sql, connection=db, echo=TRUE}\r\nSELECT count(*) \r\nFROM pragma_table_info(\"Customer\")\r\n```\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\nSELECT count(*) \r\nFROM pragma_table_info(\"Customer\")\r\n\r\nTable 1: 1 records\r\ncount(*)\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that chunk options like echo and results are all valid when using another language engine.\r\nLearn more about using other languages with R Markdown in knitr Language Engines.\r\nParameters\r\nR Markdown documents can include one or more parameters whose values can be set when you render the report.\r\n\r\nUpdate your Rmd with\r\nYAML CODE\r\nWatch the spacing and placement\r\nparams: \r\n  cars_var: \"dist\"\r\nCODE\r\n# Parameters\r\n\r\nThe YAML code above stores  `r params$cars_var` in params$cars_var.\r\n\r\n\r\n```{r select 2, message=FALSE}\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\ncars%>%\r\n  select(c(paste(params$cars_var)))\r\n\r\n```\r\nDeclaring Parameters\r\nParameters are declared using the params field within the YAML header of the document. For example, the file above creates the parameter cars_var and assigns it the default value \"dist\".\r\nUsing Parameters in Code\r\nParameters are made available within the knit environment as a read-only list named params. To access a parameter in code, call params$<parameter name>.\r\nSetting Parameters values\r\nAdd a params argument to render to create a report that uses a new set of parameter values. Here we modify our report to use the speed variable with\r\nrender(\"rmarkdown_demo.Rmd\", params = list(cars_var = \"speed\"))\r\nBetter yet, click the “Knit with Parameters” option in the dropdown menu next to the RStudio IDE knit button to set parameters, render, and preview the report in a single user friendly step.\r\n\r\nParameters are useful when you want to re-render the same report with distinct values for various key inputs, for example:\r\nRunning a report specific to a department or geographic region.\r\nRunning a report that covers a specific period in time.\r\nRunning multiple versions of a report for distinct sets of core assumptions.\r\nLearn more about parameters at Paramaterized Reports.\r\nTables\r\nBy default, R Markdown displays data frames and matrices as they would be in the R terminal (in a monospaced font). If you prefer that data be displayed with additional formatting you can use the knitr::kable function.\r\n\r\nCODE\r\n# Tables\r\n\r\n**knitr kable**\r\n```{r kable tables ,echo=FALSE, results='asis'}\r\nlibrary(knitr)\r\nkable(head(cars,5),caption=\"Kable Table\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**default table**\r\n```{r default tables, echo=FALSE}\r\nhead(cars,5)\r\n```\r\nNote the use of the results='asis' chunk option. This is required to ensure that the raw table output isn’t processed further by knitr.\r\nMarkdown Basics\r\nFormat the text in your R Markdown file with Pandoc’s Markdown, a set of markup annotations for plain text files. When you render your file, Pandoc transforms the marked up text into formatted text in your final file format.\r\nnote that header 2 is not functioning properly\r\nsyntax\r\nbecomes\r\nplain text\r\nplain text\r\nEnd a line with two spaces\r\nto start a  new paragraph\r\nEnd a line with two spaces to start a\r\nnew paragraph\r\n*italics* and _italics_\r\nitalics and italics\r\n**bold** and __bold__\r\nbold and bold\r\nsuperscript^2^\r\nsuperscript2\r\n~~strikethrough~~\r\nstrikethrough\r\n[link](www.rstudio.com)\r\nlink\r\n# Header 1\r\nHeader 1\r\n## Header 2\r\nHeader 2\r\n### Header 3\r\nHeader 3\r\n#### Header 4\r\nHeader 4\r\n##### Header 5\r\nHeader 5\r\n###### Header 6\r\nHeader 6\r\nendash: --\r\nendash: –\r\nemdash: ---\r\nemdash: —\r\nellipsis: ...\r\nellipsis: …\r\ninline equation: $A = \\pi*r^{2}$\r\ninline equation: \\(A = \\pi*r^{2}\\)\r\nimage: ![](images/VERTICAL_PRINT_maroon_cmyk.jpg)\r\n\r\nhorizontal rule (or slide break): ***\r\nhorizontal rule (or slide break):\r\n\r\n> block quote\r\n\r\nblock quote\r\n\r\n* unordered list\r\n* item 2\r\n+ sub-item 1\r\n+ sub-item 2\r\nunordered list\r\nitem 2\r\nsub-item 1\r\nsub-item 2\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ordered list\r\n2. item 2\r\n+ sub-item 1\r\n+ sub-item 2\r\nordered list\r\nitem 2\r\nsub-item 1\r\nsub-item 2\r\n\r\n\r\nTable Header | Second Header\r\n------------- | -------------\r\nTable Cell | Cell 2\r\nCell 3 | Cell 4\r\nTable Header\r\nSecond Header\r\nTable Cell\r\nCell 2\r\nCell 3\r\nCell 4\r\n\r\nCHEATSHEET\r\nCHEATSHEET2\r\nExercise #2\r\nCreate an Exercise 2 heading in your Rmd file and give at least 5 examples of syntax (don’t include any headers). Be sure and knit to check it.\r\nOutput Formats\r\nSet the output_format argument of render to render your .Rmd file into any of R Markdown’s supported formats. For example, the code below renders NAMEOFYOURFILE.Rmd to a Microsoft Word document.\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\nrender(\"NAMEOFYOURFILE.Rmd\", output_format = \"word_document\")\r\nIf you do not select a format, R Markdown renders the file to its default format, which you can set in the output field of a .Rmd file’s header. The header of NAMEOFYOURFILE.Rmd shows that it renders to an HTML file by default.\r\nThe RStudio IDE knit button renders a file to the first format listed in its output field. You can render to additional formats by clicking the dropdown menu beside the knit button:\r\n\r\nThe following output formats are available to use with R Markdown.\r\nDocuments\r\nhtml_notebook - Interactive R Notebooks\r\nhtml_document - HTML document w/ Bootstrap CSS\r\npdf_document - PDF document (via LaTeX template)\r\nword_document - Microsoft Word document (docx)\r\nodt_document - OpenDocument Text document\r\nrtf_document - Rich Text Format document\r\nmd_document - Markdown document (various flavors)\r\nPresentations (slides)\r\nioslides_presentation - HTML presentation with ioslides\r\nrevealjs::revealjs_presentation - HTML presentation with reveal.js\r\nslidy_presentation - HTML presentation with W3C Slidy\r\nbeamer_presentation - PDF presentation with LaTeX Beamer\r\npowerpoint_presentation: PowerPoint presentation\r\nMore\r\nflexdashboard::flex_dashboard - Interactive dashboards\r\ntufte::tufte_handout - PDF handouts in the style of Edward Tufte\r\ntufte::tufte_html - HTML handouts in the style of Edward Tufte\r\ntufte::tufte_book - PDF books in the style of Edward Tufte\r\nhtml_vignette - R package vignette (HTML)\r\ngithub_document - GitHub Flavored Markdown document\r\nYou can also build books, websites, and interactive documents with R Markdown.\r\nOutput Options\r\nEach output format is implemented as a function in R. You can customize the output by passing arguments to the function as sub-values of the output field.\r\n\r\nTo learn which arguments a format takes, read the format’s help page in R, e.g. ?html_document.\r\nAssignment\r\nTurn in an RMD file and a PDF of the questions and answers from Module 1. You have an example of how to connect to your database and you already have your sql code. Copy and paste the questions and add the code chunk answers. Be sure and show the code and the results.\r\n\r\nThe information for this module is from RStudio↩︎\r\n",

I am changing a few things from the PWC case study, most notably is the use of the Tidyverse R packages. I will introduce dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualizations. I am also dropping the AI/Predictive modeling portion for this class. My masters level course will focus on AI/ML.\r\nModule Objectives\r\nExplain fundamentals of statistical programming with R\r\nDemonstrate basic approaches to acquire, transform, analyze, and visualize data in R\r\nStatistical programming tools\r\n\r\nR programming basics\r\nLets create a new script to store our code. If we want to keep our code, then we must use a script. Also remember that # allows you to make comments that are not run as code. The key shortcut is:\r\nctrl (cmd)+shift+N\r\n\r\nYou can use R as a calculator:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 / 200 * 30\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.15\r\n\r\n(59 + 73 + 2) / 3\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 44.66667\r\n\r\nsin(pi / 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 1\r\n\r\nYou can create new objects with <-:\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- 3 * 4\r\nx\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 12\r\n\r\nAll R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the same form:\r\n\r\n\r\nobject_name <- value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen reading that code say “object name gets value” in your head.\r\nYou will make lots of assignments and <- is a pain to type. Don’t be lazy and use =: it will work, but it will cause confusion later.\r\nWhat’s in a name?\r\nR is case-sensitive, so objects and functions must be used with correct capitalization. Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words. I recommend snake_case where you separate lowercase words with _.\r\n\r\n\r\ni_use_snake_case\r\notherPeopleUseCamelCase\r\nsome.people.use.periods\r\nAnd_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nx_value <- 3 * 4\r\nX_value\r\n\r\n\r\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'X_value' not found\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nx_value <- 3 * 4\r\nx_Value\r\n\r\n\r\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'x_Value' not found\r\n\r\nCalling functions\r\nR has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s try using seq() which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, learn more helpful features of RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\nseq(1, 10)\r\n\r\n\r\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n\r\nType this code and notice you get similar assistance with the paired quotation marks:\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- \"hello world\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair. RStudio does its best to help you, but it’s still possible to mess up and end up with a mismatch. If this happens, R will show you the continuation character “+”:\r\n> x <- \"hello\r\n+  \r\nThe + tells you that R is waiting for more input; it doesn’t think you’re done yet. Usually that means you’ve forgotten either a \" or a ). Either add the missing pair, or press ESCAPE to abort the expression and try again.\r\nIf you make an assignment, you don’t get to see the value. You’re then tempted to immediately double-check the result:\r\n\r\n\r\ny <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5)\r\ny\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\r\n\r\nThis common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and “print to screen” to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n(y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5))\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\r\n\r\nNow look at your environment in the upper right pane. What is there?\r\nThe objects we created.\r\nInterested in keyboard shortcuts… try: Alt+Shift+K or use the menus 😄\r\nPrerequisites\r\nIn this module we are going to focus on how to use the dplyr package. If you have not already you need to install the tidyverse of packages. Installing packages is like downloading an app for your phone that adds functionality. After you download an app you have to tap it to use..in R to tap the package you use library(package_name).\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can use the data from Module 1.\r\nRemember dbname=“LOCATION OF YOUR DATABASE”\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(DBI)\r\ndb = dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = \"data/03-Data-file-classroom-exercise-Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLets move the tables into R\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomer<-dbReadTable(db,\"Customer\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvoice<-dbReadTable(db,\"Invoice\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also accomplish the same task in a RMarkdown document using SQL with the following code:\r\n```{sql, connection=db, echo=TRUE, output.var=\"Customer\"}\r\nSELECT * \r\nFROM Customer\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{sql, connection=db, echo=TRUE, output.var=\"Invoice\"}\r\nSELECT * \r\nFROM Invoice\r\n```\r\n\r\nResource for working with databases in R.\r\nLets also import our data used in Module 2. I almost always use the import wizard.\r\n\r\nThis is the code that the wizard produces for us:\r\n\r\n\r\n#don't forget libraries\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\n\r\nSession_2_data_file_1_payroll_data <- read_delim(\"data/Session-2-data-file-1-payroll_data.txt\", \"|\", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning: Duplicated column names deduplicated: 'Division' =>\r\n'Division_1' [7]\r\n\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\n\r\nSession_2_data_file_2_reference_data <- read_excel(\"data/Session-2-data-file-2-reference-data.xlsx\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Whenever we run tidyverse library it loads several packages\r\nBasic Syntax\r\nLets start with storing our imported data from Module 2 in names we like. This could have been done in the import wizard, but lets do it now.\r\n\r\n\r\nPayroll<-Session_2_data_file_1_payroll_data\r\nReference<-Session_2_data_file_2_reference_data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can remove the old datasets from our environment by using rm()\r\n\r\n\r\nrm(Session_2_data_file_1_payroll_data)\r\nrm(Session_2_data_file_2_reference_data)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point you should have a database connection “db” in your environment and 4 datasets: Customer, Invoice, Payroll, and Reference. These are the datasets used in Module 1 and Module 2. Be sure and import the original data because we are going to learn how to fix the same errors that we fixed in Module 2.\r\n\r\nWe are going to be using the dplyr package for data manipulation or data wrangling.\r\ndplyr package is loaded whenever you run library(tidyverse)\r\nOperators\r\nArithmetic Operators\r\nOperator\r\nDescription\r\n+\r\naddition\r\n-\r\nsubtraction\r\n*\r\nmultiplication\r\n/\r\ndivision\r\n^ or **\r\nexponentiation\r\nx%%y\r\nmodulus (x mod y) 5%%2 is 1\r\nx%/%y\r\ninteger division 5%/%2 is 2\r\nLogical Operators\r\nOperator\r\nDescription\r\n<\r\nless than\r\n<=\r\nless than or equal to\r\n>\r\ngreater than\r\n>=\r\ngreater than or equal to\r\n==\r\nexactly equal to\r\n!=\r\nnot equal to\r\n!x\r\nNot x\r\nx|y\r\nx OR y\r\nx&y\r\nx AND y\r\nisTRUE(x)\r\ntest if x is TRUE\r\nBuilt-in Functions\r\nR has many built in functions that compute different statistical procedures.\r\nFunctions in R are followed by ( ).\r\nInside the parenthesis we write the object (vector, array, matrix, dataframe) to which we want to apply the function.\r\nNumeric Functions\r\nFunction\r\nDescription\r\nabs(x)\r\nabsolute value\r\nsqrt(x)\r\nsquare root\r\nceiling(x)\r\nceiling(3.475) is 4\r\nfloor(x)\r\nfloor(3.475) is 3\r\ntrunc(x)\r\ntrunc(5.99) is 5\r\nround(x, digits=n)\r\nround(3.475, digits=2) is 3.48\r\nsignif(x, digits=n)\r\nsignif(3.475, digits=2) is 3.5\r\ncos(x), sin(x), tan(x)\r\nalso acos(x), cosh(x), acosh(x), etc.\r\nlog(x)\r\nnatural logarithm\r\nlog10(x)\r\ncommon logarithm\r\nexp(x)\r\ne^x\r\nCharacter Functions\r\nFunction\r\nDescription\r\nsubstr(x, start=n1, stop=n2)\r\nExtract or replace substrings in a character vector. x <- “abcdef”, substr(x, 2, 4) is “bcd”\r\ngrep(pattern, x, ignore.case=FALSE, fixed=FALSE)\r\nSearch for pattern in x.

If fixed=FALSE then pattern is a regular expression. If fixed = T then pattern is a text string. sub(\"“,”.“,”Hello There“) returns”Hello.There\"\r\nstrsplit(x, split)\r\nSplit the elements of character vector x at split. strsplit(“abc”, \"“) returns 3 element vector”a“,”b“,”c\"\r\npaste(…, sep=\"\")\r\nConcatenate strings after using sep string to seperate them. paste(“x”,1:3,sep=\"“) returns c(”x1“,”x2\" “x3”) paste(“x”,1:3,sep=“M”) returns c(“xM1”,“xM2” “xM3”) paste(“Today is”, date())\r\ntoupper(x)\r\nUppercase\r\ntolower(x)\r\nLowercase\r\nStatistical Functions\r\nFunction\r\nDescription\r\ndnorm(x)\r\nnormal density function (by default m=0 sd=1) # plot standard normal curve x <- pretty(c(-3,3), 30) y <- dnorm(x) plot(x, y, type=“l”, xlab=“Normal Deviate”, ylab=“Density”, yaxs=“i”)\r\npnorm(q)\r\ncumulative normal probability for q (area under the normal curve to the right of q) pnorm(1.96) is 0.975\r\nqnorm(p)\r\nnormal quantile. value at the p percentile of normal distribution qnorm(.9) is 1.28 # 90th percentile\r\nrnorm(n, m=0, sd=1)\r\nn random normal deviates with mean m and standard deviation sd. #50 random normal variates with mean=50, sd=10x <- rnorm(50, m=50, sd=10)\r\ndbinom(x, size, prob), pbinom(p, size,prob), qbinom(q,size,prob), rbinom(n,size,prob)\r\nbinomial distribution where size is the sample size and prob is the probability of a heads (pi) # prob of 0 to 5 heads of fair coin out of 10 flips dbinom(0:5, 10, .5) # prob of 5 or less heads of fair coin out of 10 flips pbinom(5, 10, .5)\r\ndpois(x, lamda), ppois(q,lamda), qpois(p,lamda), rpois(n,lamda)\r\npoisson distribution with m=std=lamda #probability of 0,1, or 2 events with lamda=4 dpois(0:2, 4) # probability of at least 3 events with lamda=4 1- ppois(2,4)\r\ndunif(x,min,max=1)\r\nuniform distribution, follows the same pattern\r\npunif(q,min=0,max=1)\r\nas the normal distribution above.\r\nqunif(p,min=0,max=1)\r\n#10 uniform random variates\r\nrunif(n,min=0,max=1)\r\nx <- runif(10)\r\nmean(x,trim=0, na.rm=FALSE)\r\nmean of object x, # trimmed mean, removing any missing values and # 5 percent of highest and lowest scores mx <- mean(x,trim=.05,na.rm=TRUE)\r\nsd(x)\r\nstandard deviation of object(x). also look at var(x) for variance and mad(x) for median absolute deviation.\r\nmedian(x)\r\nmedian\r\nquantile(x)\r\nquantiles where x is the numeric vector whose quantiles are desired and probs is a numeric vector with probabilities in [0,1]. # 30th and 84th percentiles of x, y <- quantile(x, c(.3,.84))\r\nrange(x)\r\nrange\r\nsum(x)\r\nsum\r\ndiff(x,lag=1)\r\nlagged differences, with lag indicating which lag to use\r\nmin(x)\r\nminimum\r\nmax(x)\r\nmaximum\r\nscale(x, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)\r\ncolumn center or standardize a matrix\r\nOther Functions\r\nFunction\r\nDescription\r\nseq(from, to, by)\r\ngenerate a sequence indices <- seq(1,10,2) #indices is c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)\r\nrep(x,ntimes)\r\nrepeat x n times y <- rep(1:3, 2) # y is c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)\r\ncut(x,n)\r\ndivide continuous variable in factor with n levels y <- cut(x, 5)\r\nlength(object)\r\nnumber of elements or components\r\nstr(object)\r\nstructure of an object\r\nclass(object)\r\nclass or type of an object\r\nnames(object)\r\nnames\r\nc(object, object,…)\r\ncombine objects into a vector\r\ncbind(object, object,…)\r\ncombine objects as columns\r\nrbind(object, object,…)\r\ncombine objects as rows\r\nls()\r\nlist current objects\r\nrm(object)\r\ndelete an object\r\nnewobject <- edit(object)\r\ncreate a new object\r\nfix(object)\r\nedit an object in place\r\nDplyr\r\nPipes %>%\r\nBefore we start data wrangling, let’s first introduce a tool that gets loaded with the dplyr package: the pipe operator %>%. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in R into a single sequential chain of actions.\r\nLet’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():\r\nTake x then\r\nUse x as an input to a function f() then\r\nUse the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then\r\nUse the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h()\r\nOne way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows…This is how Excel works. We saw this multiple times in Module 2.\r\nh(g(f(x)))\r\nThis isn’t terrible, but as we saw…as you nest more things it gets more complicated. This is where the pipe operator %>% comes in handy. %>% takes the output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read %>% as “then” or “and then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows:\r\nx %>% \r\n  f() %>% \r\n  g() %>% \r\n  h()\r\nYou would read this sequence as:\r\nTake x then\r\nUse this output as the input to the next function f() then\r\nUse this output as the input to the next function g() then\r\nUse this output as the input to the next function h()\r\nSo while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n#lets look at some pipes\r\nUSA_Customer <- Customer %>%\r\n  filter(Country==\"USA\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a Peek\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: The resulting data\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomerId\r\n\r\n\r\nFirstName\r\n\r\n\r\nLastName\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress\r\n\r\n\r\nCity\r\n\r\n\r\nState\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry\r\n\r\n\r\nPostalCode\r\n\r\n\r\nPhone\r\n\r\n\r\nFax\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail\r\n\r\n\r\nSupportRepId\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank\r\n\r\n\r\nHarris\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Inc. \r\n\r\n\r\n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\r\n\r\n\r\nMountain View\r\n\r\n\r\nCA\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n94043-1351\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (650) 253-0000\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (650) 253-0000\r\n\r\n\r\nfharris@google.com\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\nJack\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Corporation\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Microsoft Way\r\n\r\n\r\nRedmond\r\n\r\n\r\nWA\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n98052-8300\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (425) 882-8080\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (425) 882-8081\r\n\r\n\r\njacksmith@microsoft.com\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\nMichelle\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooks\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n627 Broadway\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York\r\n\r\n\r\nNY\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n10012-2612\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (212) 221-3546\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (212) 221-4679\r\n\r\n\r\nmichelleb@aol.com\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n\r\nGoyer\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Inc. \r\n\r\n\r\n1 Infinite Loop\r\n\r\n\r\nCupertino\r\n\r\n\r\nCA\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n95014\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (408) 996-1010\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (408) 996-1011\r\n\r\n\r\ntgoyer@apple.com\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n541 Del Medio Avenue\r\n\r\n\r\nMountain View\r\n\r\n\r\nCA\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n94040-111\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (650) 644-3358\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\ndmiller@comcast.com\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\r\nKathy\r\n\r\n\r\nChase\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n801 W 4th Street\r\n\r\n\r\nReno\r\n\r\n\r\nNV\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n89503\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (775) 223-7665\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\nkachase@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\r\nHeather\r\n\r\n\r\nLeacock\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n120 S Orange Ave\r\n\r\n\r\nOrlando\r\n\r\n\r\nFL\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n32801\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (407) 999-7788\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\nhleacock@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n\r\nGordon\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n69 Salem Street\r\n\r\n\r\nBoston\r\n\r\n\r\nMA\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n2113\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (617) 522-1333\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\njohngordon22@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank\r\n\r\n\r\nRalston\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n162 E Superior Street\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago\r\n\r\n\r\nIL\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n60611\r\n\r\n\r\n+1 (312) 332-3232\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\nfralston@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n\r\nVictor\r\n\r\n\r\nStevens\r\n\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n\r\n319 N.

In other words, assign different rows to be part of the same group. We can then combine group_by() with summarize() to report summary statistics for each group separately. For example, say you don’t want a single overall average sales for a company, but want it by department.\r\nmutate() its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, you can create ROA from income divided by assets.\r\narrange() its rows. Sorting rows.\r\njoin() it with another data frame by matching along a “key” variable. In other words, merge these two data frames together. This is similar to what we saw in Module 1.\r\nfilter\r\nThe filter() function here works much like the “Filter” option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variable in your dataset and then filters out only the rows that match that criteria.\r\nNote: not including the select function is similar to including SELECT * in SQL.

The Country must be \"USA\" and the SupportRepid must be greater than or equal to 4.\r\nYou can use the “not” operator !.

Commonly known examples of summary statistics include the mean (also called the average) and the median (the middle value). Other examples of summary statistics that might not immediately come to mind include the sum, the smallest value also called the minimum, the largest value also called the maximum, and the standard deviation.\r\nWithin summarize here are a few examples of functions that can be used:\r\nmean(): the average\r\nsd(): the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread\r\nmin() and max(): the minimum and maximum values, respectively\r\nIQR(): interquartile range\r\nsum(): the total amount when adding multiple numbers\r\nn(): a count of the number of rows\r\nLets look at a few examples\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary_invoice<-Invoice%>%\r\n  summarize(mean_total=mean(Total,na.rm=TRUE))\r\n\r\nsummary_invoice\r\n\r\n\r\n  mean_total\r\n1   5.651942\r\n\r\nWhat does the na.rm=TRUE do?\r\nBefore we investigate that we need to clean up one of our variables in the Payroll data set.\r\n\r\n\r\nclass(Payroll$`Overtime Pay`)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"character\"\r\n\r\nWe have a couple issues here:\r\nOvertime Pay does not conform to a good naming convention. Clearly R can deal with the space, but it is likely to make things more difficult later.\r\nOvertime Pay is a character, but we know it should be numeric\r\nAnother issue is the comma and if we were using the salary column the $ would be a problem.\r\n\r\nLet’s change the name with the rename function:\r\n\r\n\r\nPayroll<-Payroll%>%\r\n  #syntax:  new_name=old_name\r\n  rename(Overtime_Pay=`Overtime Pay`)\r\n\r\nsummary(Payroll$Overtime_Pay)\r\n\r\n\r\n   Length     Class      Mode \r\n      201 character character \r\n\r\nBefore we can convert the character to a number we need to remove the commas… 😢 and then use as.numeric . When we convert to ‘numeric’ with as.numeric, all the non-numeric elements are converted to NA. So, we need to remove , to make it work.\r\nMore on mutate later\r\n\r\n\r\n#?gsub\r\n#?as.numeric\r\n\r\nPayroll2<-Payroll%>%\r\n  #nested formula: gsub in as.numeric\r\n  mutate(Overtime_Pay=as.numeric(gsub('[,]', '',Overtime_Pay)))\r\n\r\nsummary(Payroll2$Overtime_Pay)\r\n\r\n\r\n   Min. 1st Qu.

If it confuses you, then ignore it.\r\nIt is important to note that the group_by() function doesn’t change data frames by itself.

wrangling tasks is to sort a data frame’s rows in the alphanumeric order of one of the variables. The dplyr package’s arrange() function allows us to sort/reorder a data frame’s rows according to the values of the specified variable.\r\narrange() works similarly to filter() except that instead of selecting rows, it changes their order. It takes a data frame and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nArranged_Acid<-AcidTest_Ratio%>%\r\n

company has low ….\r\nJoin\r\nIt’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data. Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to answer the questions that you’re interested in. Collectively, multiple tables of data are called relational data because it is the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important.\r\nRelations are always defined between a pair of tables. All other relations are built up from this simple idea: the relations of three or more tables are always a property of the relations between each pair. Sometimes both elements of a pair can be the same table! This is needed if, for example, you have a table of people, and each person has a reference to their parents.\r\nTo work with relational data you need verbs that work with pairs of tables. There are three families of verbs designed to work with relational data:\r\nMutating joins, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.\r\nFiltering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.\r\nSet operations, which treat observations as if they were set elements.\r\nThe most common place to find relational data is in a relational database management system (or RDBMS), a term that encompasses almost all modern databases. If you’ve used a database before, you’ve almost certainly used SQL. If so, you should find the concepts in this chapter familiar, although their expression in dplyr is a little different. Generally, dplyr is a little easier to use than SQL because dplyr is specialized to do data analysis: it makes common data analysis operations easier, at the expense of making it more difficult to do other things that aren’t commonly needed for data analysis.\r\nLets get some data:\r\n\r\n\r\n    library(DBI)\r\n    library(RSQLite)\r\n    db = dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = \"data/03-Data-file-classroom-exercise-Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite\")\r\n\r\n    #list tables\r\n    dbListTables(db)\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] \"Album\"         \"Artist\"        \"Customer\"      \"Employee\"     \r\n [5] \"Genre\"         \"Invoice\"       \"InvoiceLine\"   \"MediaType\"    \r\n [9] \"Playlist\"      \"PlaylistTrack\" \"Track\"         \"invoice_high\" \r\n\r\n\r\nImport some data\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack<-dbReadTable(db, \"Track\")\r\n\r\nInvoiceLine<-dbReadTable(db, \"InvoiceLine\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variables used to connect each pair of tables are called keys. A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation. In simple cases, a single variable is sufficient to identify an observation. For track, each song is uniquely identified by its TrackId. In other cases, multiple variables may be needed. For example CompanyName and FiscalYear like in our financial dataset (AnnualCompanyData).\r\nThere are two types of keys:\r\nA primary key uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, Track$TrackId is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each song in the Track table.\r\nA foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, InvoiceLine$TrackId is a foreign key because it appears in the Track table where it matches each track ID to a unique song.\r\nA variable can be both a primary key and a foreign key.\r\nOnce you’ve identified the primary keys in your tables, it’s good practice to verify that they do indeed uniquely identify each observation. One way to do that is to count() the primary keys and look for entries where n is greater than one:\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack%>%\r\n  count(TrackId)%>%\r\n  filter(n>1)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] TrackId n      \r\n<0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)\r\n\r\nSo, no instances where TrackId appears more than once.

tracks appear a couple times in InvoiceLine.\r\nIf a table lacks a primary key, it’s sometimes useful to add one with mutate() and row_number(). That makes it easier to match observations if you’ve done some filtering and want to check back in with the original data. This is called a surrogate key.\r\nA primary key and the corresponding foreign key in another table form a relation. Relations are typically one-to-many. In other data, you’ll occasionally see a 1-to-1 relationship. You can think of this as a special case of 1-to-many. You can model many-to-many relations with a many-to-1 relation plus a 1-to-many relation. These usually involve linking tables.\r\nTo help you learn how joins work, I’m going to use a visual representation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- tribble(\r\n  ~key, ~val_x,\r\n     1, \"x1\",\r\n     2, \"x2\",\r\n     3, \"x3\"\r\n)\r\ny <- tribble(\r\n  ~key, ~val_y,\r\n     1, \"y1\",\r\n     2, \"y2\",\r\n     4, \"y3\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colored column represents the “key” variable: these are used to match the rows between the tables. The grey column represents the “value” column that is carried along for the ride. In these examples I’ll show a single key variable, but the idea generalizes in a straightforward way to multiple keys and multiple values.\r\nA join is a way of connecting each row in x to zero, one, or more rows in y. The following diagram shows each potential match as an intersection of a pair of lines.\r\n\r\n(If you look closely, you might notice that we’ve switched the order of the key and value columns in x. This is to emphasise that joins match based on the key; the value is just carried along for the ride.)\r\nIn an actual join, matches will be indicated with dots. The number of dots = the number of matches = the number of rows in the output.\r\n\r\nInner Join\r\nThe simplest type of join is the inner join. An inner join matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal:\r\n\r\n(To be precise, this is an inner equijoin because the keys are matched using the equality operator. Since most joins are equijoins we usually drop that specification.)\r\nThe output of an inner join is a new data frame that contains the key, the x values, and the y values. We use by to tell dplyr which variable is the key:\r\n\r\n\r\nx %>% \r\n  inner_join(y, by = \"key\")\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 2 x 3\r\n    key val_x val_y\r\n  <dbl> <chr> <chr>\r\n1     1 x1    y1   \r\n2     2 x2    y2   \r\n\r\nThe most important property of an inner join is that unmatched rows are not included in the result. This means that generally inner joins are usually not appropriate for use in analysis because it’s too easy to lose observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
